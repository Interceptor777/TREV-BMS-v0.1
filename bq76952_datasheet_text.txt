(1) Operation outside the Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent device damage. Absolute Maximum Ratings  do not imply 
functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those listed under Recommended Operating Conditions . If 
outside the Recommended Operating Conditions  but within the Absolute Maximum Ratings , the device may not be fully functional, and 
this may affect device reliability, functionality, performance, and shorten the device lifetime.
(2) The current allowed to flow into the FUSE pin must be limited (such as by using external series resistance) to 2 mA or less.
(3) When the ALERT, HDQ, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, DCHG, or DDSG pins are selected for thermistor input or general purpose ADC–input, 
their voltage is limited to V REG18  + 0.3 V. These pins can accept up to 6 V when configured for other uses, such as a digital input.

8 Device Description
8.1 Overview
The BQ76952 device is a highly integrated, accurate battery monitor and protector for 3-series to 16-series 
Li-ion, Li-polymer, and LiFePO 4 battery packs. A high-accuracy voltage, current, and temperature measurement 
provides data for host-based algorithms and control. A feature-rich and highly configurable protection subsystem 
provides a wide set of protections that can be triggered and recovered completely autonomously by the device 
or under full control of a host processor. The integrated charge pump with high-side protection NFET drivers 
enables host communication with the device even when FETs are off by preserving the ground connection to the 
pack. Dual programmable LDOs are included for external system use, with each independently programmable to 
voltages of 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.0 V, 3.3 V, and 5.0 V, capable of providing up to 45 mA each.
The BQ76952 device includes one-time-programmable (OTP) memory for customers to set up device operation 
on their own production line. Multiple communications interfaces are supported, including 400-kHz I2C, SPI, and 
HDQ one-wire standards. Multiple digital control and status data are available through several multifunction pins 
on the device, including an interrupt to the host processor, and independent controls for host override of each 
high-side protection NFET. Three dedicated pins enable temperature measurements using external thermistors, 
and multifunction pins can be programmed to use for additional thermistors, supporting a total of up to nine 
thermistors, in addition to an internal die temperature measurement.BQ76952

8.3 BQ76952 Device Versions
The BQ76952 device family includes several versions with differing default settings programmed during factory 
test. These different settings, which may include having a different default communications interface or a 
different setting for the REG1 LDO, are described in the Device Comparison Table .
8.4 Diagnostics
The BQ76952 device includes a suite of diagnostic tests that the system can use to improve operation 
robustness. These include comparisons between the two voltage references integrated within the device, a 
hardware monitor of the LFO frequency, memory checks at power-up or reset, an internal watchdog on the 
embedded processor, and more. The BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual  describes these in detail.www.ti.comBQ76952

9 Device Configuration
9.1 Commands and Subcommands
The BQ76952 device includes support for direct commands and subcommands. The direct commands are 
accessed using a 7-bit command address that is sent from a host through the device serial communications 
interface and either triggers an action, provides a data value to be written to the device, or instructs the device 
to report data back to the host. Subcommands are additional commands that are accessed indirectly using the 
7-bit command address space and provide the capability for block data transfers. For more information on the 
commands and subcommands supported by the device, refer to the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual .
9.2 Configuration Using OTP or Registers
The BQ76952 device includes registers, with values that are stored in the RAM and can be loaded automatically 
from one-time programmable (OTP) memory. At initial power-up, the device loads OTP settings into registers, 
which are used by the device firmware during operation. The recommended procedure is for the customer to 
write settings into OTP on the manufacturing line, in which case the device will use these settings whenever it 
is powered up. Alternatively, the host processor can initialize registers after power-up, without using the OTP 
memory, but the registers will need to be reinitialized after each power cycle of the device. Register values are 
preserved while the device is in NORMAL, SLEEP, or DEEPSLEEP modes. If the device enters SHUTDOWN 
mode, all register memory is cleared, and the device returns to the default parameters (or the OTP configuration 
if that has been programmed) when powered again. See the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual  for more 
details.
9.3 Device Security
The BQ76952 device includes three security modes: SEALED, UNSEALED, and FULLACCESS, which can be 
used to limit the ability to view or change settings.
•In SEALED mode, most data and status can be read using commands and subcommands, but only selected 
settings can be changed. Data memory settings cannot be changed directly.
•UNSEALED mode includes SEALED functionality, and also adds the ability to execute additional 
subcommands, and read and write data memory.
•FULLACCESS mode allows capability to read and modify all device settings, including writing OTP memory.
Selected settings in the device can be modified while the device is in operation through supported commands 
and subcommands, but in order to modify all settings, the device must enter CONFIG_UPDATE mode (see 
Section 13.6), which stops device operation while settings are being updated. After the update is completed, the 
operation is restarted using the new settings. CONFIG_UPDATE mode is only available in FULLACCESS mode.
The BQ76952 device implements a key-access scheme to transition among SEALED, UNSEALED, and 
FULLACCESS modes. Each transition requires that a unique set of keys be sent to the device through 
subcommands. Refer to the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual  for more details.
The device provides additional checks which can be used to optimize system robustness, including 
subcommands which calculate the digital signature of the integrated instruction ROM and data ROM. These 
signatures should never change for a particular product. If these were to change, it would indicate an error, either 
that the ROM had been corrupted, or the readback of the ROM or calculation of the signature experienced an 
error. An additional subcommand calculates a digital signature for the static configuration data (which excludes 
calibration values) and compares it to a stored value, returning a flag if the result does not match.
9.4 Scratchpad Memory
The BQ76952 device integrates a 32-byte scratchpad memory which can be used by the customer for storing 
manufacturing data, such as serial numbers, production or test dates, and so forth. The scratchpad data can be 
written into OTP memory on the customer production line. This data can only be written while in FULLACCESS 
mode, although it can be read in all modes.BQ76952

10 Measurement Subsystem
10.1 Voltage Measurement
The BQ76952 device integrates a voltage ADC that is multiplexed between measurements of cell voltages, 
an internal temperature sensor, and up to nine external thermistors, as well as performs measurements of 
the voltage at the VC16 pin, the PACK pin, the LD pin, the internal REG18 LDO voltage, and the VSS rail 
(for diagnostic purposes). The BQ76952 device supports measurement of individual differential cell voltages 
in a series configuration, ranging from 3-series cells to 16-series cells. Each cell voltage measurement is a 
differential measurement of the voltage between two adjacent cell input pins, such as VC1-VC0, VC2-VC1, and 
so forth. The cell voltage measurements are processed based on trim and calibration corrections, and then 
reported in 16-bit resolution using units of 1 mV. The raw 24-bit digital output of the ADC is also available 
for readout using 32-bit subcommands. The cell voltage measurements can support a recommended voltage 
range from –0.2 V to 5.5 V. The voltage ADC saturates at a level of 5 × VREF1 (approximately 6.06 V) when 
measuring cell voltages, although for best performance it is recommended to stay at a maximum input of 5.5 V.
10.1.1 Voltage Measurement Schedule
The BQ76952 voltage measurements are taken in a measurement loop that consists of multiple measurement 
slots. All 16 cell voltages are measured on each loop, then one slot is used for one of the VC16 or PACK or 
LD pin voltages, one slot is used for internal temperature or Vref or VSS measurement, then up to three slots 
are used to measure thermistors or multifunction pin voltages (ADCIN functionality). Over the course of three 
loops, a full set of measurements is completed. One measurement loop consists of either 18 (if no thermistors or 
ADCIN are enabled), 19 (if one thermistor or ADCIN is enabled), 20 (if two thermistors or ADCIN are enabled), 
or 21 (if three or more thermistors or ADCIN are enabled) measurement slots.
The speed of a measurement loop can be controlled by settings. Each voltage measurement (slot) takes 3 ms 
(or 1.5 ms depending on setting), so a typical measurement loop with 21 slots per loop takes 63 ms (or 31.5 ms 
depending on setting). If measurement data is not required as quickly, the timing for the measurement loop can 
be programmed to slower speeds, which injects idle slots in each loop after the measurement slots. Using slower 
loop cycle time will reduce the power dissipation of the device when in NORMAL mode.
10.1.2 Usage of VC Pins for Cells Versus Interconnect
If the BQ76952 device is used in a system with fewer than 16-series cells, the additional cell inputs can be 
utilized to improve measurement performance. For example, a long connection may exist between two cells in a 
pack, such that there may be significant interconnect resistance between the cells, such as shown in Figure 10-1 
between CELL-A and CELL-B. By connecting VC12 close to the positive terminal of CELL-B, and connecting 
VC13 close to the negative terminal of CELL-A, more accurate cell voltage measurements are obtained for 
CELL-A and CELL-B, since the I·R voltage across the interconnect resistance between the cells is not included 
in either cell voltage measurement. Since the device reports the voltage across the interconnect resistance 
and the synchronized current, the resistance of the interconnect between CELL-A and CELL-B can also be 
calculated and monitored during operation. It is recommended to include the series resistance and bypass 
capacitor on cell inputs connected in this manner, as shown below.
Note
It is important that the differential input for each cell input not fall below –0.3 V (the Absolute Maximum 
data sheet limit), with the recommended minimum voltage of –0.2 V. Therefore, it is important that the 
I·R voltage drop across the interconnect resistance does not cause a violation of this requirement.www.ti.comBQ76952

Figure 10-2. Terminating an Unused Cell Input Pin
A configuration register is used to specify which cell inputs are used for actual cells. The device uses this 
information to disable cell voltage protections associated with inputs which are used to measure interconnect or 
are not used at all. Voltage measurements for all inputs are reported in 16-bit format (in units of mV) as well as 
32-bit format (in units of raw ADC counts), irrespective of whether they are used for cells or not.
10.1.3 Cell 1 Voltage Validation During SLEEP Mode
In rare cases, an invalid Cell 1 Voltage()  reading has been observed to occur in some devices taken during 
SLEEP mode.BQ76952

================================================================================

While the device is in SLEEP mode, each result obtained from reading the Cell 1 Voltage()  must be validated 
before it can be considered valid. During SLEEP mode, current is below programmable thresholds, so the pack 
is typically not being charged or discharged with any significant level of current. Thus, the cell voltages will 
generally not be changing significantly.
In order to determine if a measurement of Cell 1 Voltage()  taken during SLEEP mode is valid, it is necessary to 
compare each measurement to measurements taken before and after the particular measurement. It is important 
that these three readings represent three separate measurements  for the Cell 1 Voltage() . If the reading is 
significantly different from the separate readings taken before and after, then that reading is considered invalid 
and should be discarded.
In order to ensure the three measurements read from the device are truly separate measurements , the host 
can read the measurements at intervals exceeding Power:Sleep:Voltage Time  while the device is in SLEEP 
mode. This is necessary to avoid the host reading an existing measurement multiple times, before a new 
measurement has been taken and is available for readout.
An invalid Cell 1 Voltage()  reading may result in an SUV PF Alert being set but does not result in an SUV PF 
status fault if the SUV Delay is set to 1 second or longer. It also does not trigger a Cell Undervoltage (CUV) 
Protection alert or status fault, since this protection uses a comparator for its detection. If a reading reported by 
Cell 1 Voltage()  is below the Protections:CUV:Threshold  level and the CUV protection is enabled, but the CUV 
Alert is not triggered, this also can be used as an indication the reading is invalid.
This validation process is necessary to ensure that valid Cell 1 Voltage()  results are measured.
10.2 General Purpose ADCIN Functionality
Several multifunction pins on the BQ76952 device can be used for general purpose ADC input (ADCIN) 
measurement, if not being used for other purposes. This includes the TS1, TS2, TS3, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, 
HDQ, DCHG, DDSG, and ALERT pins. When used for ADCIN functionality, the internal bandgap reference is 
used by the ADC, and the input range of the ADC is limited to the REG18 pin voltage. The digital fullscale range 
of the ADC is effectively 1.6667 × VREF1, which is approximately 2.02 V during normal operation.
The BQ76952 device also reports the raw ADC counts when a measurement is taken using the TS1 pin. This 
data can be used during manufacturing to better calibrate the ADCIN functionality.
10.3 Coulomb Counter and Digital Filters
The BQ76952 device monitors pack current using a low-side sense resistor, which connects to the SRP and 
SRN pins through an external RC filter, which should be connected such that a charging current will create 
a positive voltage on SRP relative to SRN. The differential voltage between SRP and SRN is digitized by an 
integrated coulomb counter ADC, which can digitize voltages over a ±200 mV range and uses multiple digital 
filters to provide optimized measurement of the instantaneous, averaged, and integrated current. The device 
supports a wide range of sense resistor value, with a larger value providing better resolution for the digitized 
result. The maximum value of sense resistor should be limited to ensure the differential voltage remains within 
the ±200 mV range for system operation when current measurement is desired. For example, a system with 
maximum discharge current of 200 A during normal operation (not a fault condition) should limit the sense 
resistor to 1 mΩ or below.
The SRP and SRN pins can also support higher positive voltages relative to VSS, such as may occur during 
overcurrent or short circuit in discharge conditions, without damage to the device, although the current is not 
accurately digitized in this case. For example, a system with a 1 m Ω sense resistor and the Short Circuit in 
Discharge protection threshold programmed to a 500 mV level would trigger an SCD protection fault when a 
discharge current of 500 A was detected.
Multiple digitized current values are available for readout over the serial communications interface, including two 
using separate hardware digital filters, CC1 and CC2, as well as a firmware filter CC3.
The CC1 filter generates a 16-bit current measurement that is used for charge integration and other decision 
purposes, with one output generated every 250 ms when the device is operating in NORMAL mode.www.ti.comBQ76952

Product Folder Links: BQ76952


================================================================================
PAGE 38 of 87
================================================================================

The CC2 filter generates a 24-bit current measurement that is used for current reporting, with one output every 
3 ms when the device is operating in NORMAL mode (which can be reduced to one output every 1.5 ms based 
on setting, with reduced measurement resolution). It is reported in 16-bit format, and the 24-bit CC2 data is also 
available as raw coulomb counter ADC counts, provided in a 32-bit format (with the data contained in the lower 
24-bits and the upper 8-bits sign-extended).
The CC3 filter output is an average of a programmable number of CC2 current samples (up to 255), based on 
the configuration setting. The CC3 output is reported in 32-bit format.
The integrated passed charge is available as a 64-bit value, which includes the upper 32-bits of accumulated 
charge as the integer portion, the lower 32-bits of accumulated charge as the fractional portion, and a 32-bit 
accumulated time over which the charge has been integrated in units of seconds. The accumulated charge 
integration and timer can be reset by a command from the host over the digital communications interface.
10.4 Synchronized Voltage and Current Measurement
While the cell voltages are digitized sequentially using a single muxed ADC during normal operation, the current 
is digitized continuously by the dedicated coulomb counter ADC. The current is measured synchronously with 
each cell voltage measurement, and can be used for individual cell impedance analysis. The ongoing periodic 
current measurements can be read out through the digital communication interface, while the measurements 
taken that were synchronized with particular cell voltage measurements are stored paired with the associated 
cell voltage measurement for separate readout. These values can be read using a block subcommand, which 
ensures the synchronously aligned voltage and current data are read out together.
10.5 Internal Temperature Measurement
The BQ76952 device integrates the capability to measure its internal die temperature by digitizing the difference 
in internal transistor base-emitter voltages (delta-V BE). This voltage is measured periodically as part of the 
measurement loop and is processed to provide a reported temperature value available through the digital 
communications interface. This internal temperature measurement can be used for cell or FET temperature 
protections and logic based on configuration settings.
10.6 Thermistor Temperature Measurement
The BQ76952 device includes an on-chip temperature measurement and can also support up to nine external 
thermistors on multifunction pins (TS1, TS2, TS3, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, ALERT, HDQ, DCHG, and DDSG). The 
device includes an internal pullup resistor to bias a thermistor during measurement.
The internal pullup resistor has two options which can set the pullup resistor to either 18-k Ω or 180-kΩ (or none 
at all). The 18-k Ω option is intended for use with thermistors such as the Semitec 103-AT, which has 10-k Ω 
resistance at room temperature. The 180-k Ω is intended for use with higher resistance thermistors such as 
the Semitec 204AP-2, which has 200-k Ω resistance at room temperature. The resistor values are measured 
during factory production and stored within the device for use during temperature calculation. The individual pin 
configuration registers determine which pin is used for a thermistor measurement, what value of pullup resistor is 
used, as well as whether the thermistor measurement is used for a cell or FET temperature reading.BQ76952

To provide a high precision temperature result, the device uses the same 1.8 V LDO voltage for the ADC 
reference as is used for biasing the thermistor pullup resistor, thereby implementing a ratiometric measurement 
that removes the error contribution from the LDO voltage level. The device processes the digitized thermistor 
voltage to calculate the temperature based on multiorder polynomials, which can be programmed by the user 
based on the specific thermistor selected.
10.7 Factory Trim of Voltage ADC
The BQ76952 device includes factory trim for the cell voltage ADC measurements in order to optimize the 
voltage measurement performance even if no further calibration is performed by the customer. Calibration can 
be performed by the customer on the production line to further optimize the performance in the system. The 
trim information is used to correct the raw ADC readings before they are reported as 16-bit voltage values. The 
32-bit ADC voltage data, which is generated in units of ADC counts, is modified before reporting by subtracting 
a stored offset trim value. The resulting reported data does not include any further correction (such as for gain), 
therefore the customer will need to process them before use.
The device includes a factory gain trim for the voltage measurements performed using the general purpose ADC 
input capability on the multifunction pins as well as the TS1, TS2, and TS3 pins. It also includes factory gain trim 
on the voltage measurements of the PACK pin, the LD pin, and the top-of-stack (VC16) pin.
10.8 Voltage Calibration (ADC Measurements)
The BQ76952 device includes optional capability for the customer to calibrate each cell voltage gain and 
the gain for the stack voltage, the PACK pin voltage, and the LD pin voltage individually, and multifunction 
pin general ADC measurements. An offset calibration value Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell Offset  is included 
for use with the cell voltage measurements, and Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset  is used with the TOS 
(stack), PACK, and LD voltage measurements. The cell voltage gains determined during calibration are written 
in Calibration:Voltage:Cell 1 Gain – Cell 16 Gain , where Cell 1 Gain  is used for the measurement of VC1–
VC0, Cell 2 Gain  is used for the measurement of VC2–VC1, and so forth. Similarly, the calibration voltage 
gain for the TOS voltage should be written in Calibration:Voltage:TOS Gain , the PACK pin voltage gain in 
Calibration:Voltage:Pack Gain , the LD pin voltage gain in Calibration:Voltage:LD Gain , and multifunction pin 
general purpose ADCIN measurement gain in Calibration:Voltage:ADC Gain .www.ti.comBQ76952

================================================================================
PAGE 40 of 87
================================================================================

If values for the calibration gain configuration are not written, the BQ76952 device will use factory trim or default 
values for the respective gain values. When a calibration gain configuration value is written, the device will use 
that in place of any factory trim or default gain. The raw ADC measurement data (in units of counts) is corrected 
by first subtracting a stored offset trim value, then the gain is applied, then the Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell 
Offset  (for cell voltage measurements) or the Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset  (for TOS, PACK, or LD 
voltage measurements) is subtracted, before the final voltage value is reported.
The factory trim values for the Cell Gain parameters can be read from the Cell Gain data memory registers 
while in FULLACCESS mode but not in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, if the data memory values have not been 
overwritten. While in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, the Cell Gain values will read back either with all zeros, 
if they have not been overwritten, or whatever values have been written to these registers. Upon exiting 
CONFIG_UPDATE mode, readback of the Cell Gain parameters will provide the values presently used in 
operation.
Further detail on calibration procedures can be found in the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual .
The effective fullscale digital range of the cell measurement is 5 × VREF1, and the effective fullscale digital 
range of the ADCIN measurement is 1.667 × VREF1, although the voltages applied for these measurement 
should be limited based on the specifications in Section 7. Using a value for VREF1 of 1.212 V, the nominal gain 
for the cell measurements is 12120, while the nominal gain for the ADCIN measurements is 4040. The reported 
voltages are calculated as:
Cell # Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:Cell # Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536 – Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell Offset
Stack Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:TOS Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536 – Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset
PACK Pin Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:Pack Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536 – Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset
LD Pin Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:LD Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536 – Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset
ADCIN Voltage = Calibration:Voltage:ADC Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536
Note
Cell # Voltage()  and Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell Offset  both have units of mV. The divider 
voltages ( Stack Voltage() , PACK Pin Voltage() , and LD Pin Voltage() ) and Calibration:Vdiv 
Offset:Vdiv Offset  all have units of userV.
10.9 Voltage Calibration (COV and CUV Protections)
The BQ76952 device includes optional capability for the customer to calibrate the COV (cell overvoltage) and 
CUV (cell undervoltage) protection thresholds on the production line, in order to improve threshold accuracy in 
system or to realize a threshold between the preset thresholds available from the device.
This calibration is performed while the device is in CONFIG_UPDATE mode. To calibrate the COV threshold, 
an external voltage is first applied between VC16 and VC15 that is equal to the desired COV threshold. 
Next, the CAL_COV()  subcommand is sent by the host, which causes the BQ76952 device to perform a 
search for the appropriate calibration coefficients to realize a COV threshold at or close to the applied voltage 
level. When this search is completed, the resulting calibration coefficient is returned by the subcommand 
and automatically written into the Protections:COV:COV Threshold Override  configuration parameter. If this 
parameter is nonzero, the device will not use its factory trim settings but will instead use this value.
The CUV threshold is calibrated similarly, an external voltage is applied between VC16 and VC15 equal to the 
desired CUV threshold. Next, while in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, the CAL_CUV()  subcommand is sent by the 
host, which causes the BQ76952 device to perform a search for the appropriate calibration coefficients to realize 
a CUV threshold at or close to the applied voltage level. When this search is completed, the resulting calibration 
coefficient is returned by the subcommand and automatically written into the Protections:CUV:CUV Threshold 
Override  configuration parameter.BQ76952

10.10 Current Calibration
The BQ76952 device coulomb counter ADC measures the differential voltage between the SRP and SRN pins 
to calculate the system current. The device includes the optional capability for the customer to calibrate the 
coulomb counter offset and current gain on the production line.
The Calibration:Current Offset:CC Offset  configuration register contains an offset value in units of 32-bit 
coulomb counter ADC counts / Calibration:Current Offset:Coulomb Counter Offset Samples . The value of 
Calibration:Current Offset:CC Offset  / Calibration:Current Offset:Coulomb Counter Offset Samples  is 
subtracted from the raw coulomb counter ADC counts, then the result is multiplied by Calibration:Current:CC 
Gain  and scaled to provide the final result in units of userA.
The BQ76952 device uses the Calibration:Current:CC Gain  and Calibration:Current:Capacity Gain 
configuration values to convert from the ADC value to current. The CC Gain  reflects the value of the sense 
resistor used in the system, while the Capacity Gain  is simply the CC Gain  multiplied by 298261.6178.
Both the CC Gain  and Capacity Gain  are encoded using a 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point format. The effective 
value of the sense resistor is given by:
CC Gain  = 7.4768 / (Rsense in mΩ)
10.11 Temperature Calibration
The BQ76952 device enables the customer to calibrate the internal as well as external temperature 
measurements on the production line, by storing an offset value that is added to the calculated measurement 
before reporting. A separate offset for each temperature measurement can be stored in the configuration 
registers shown below.

11 Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems
11.1 Protections Overview
An extensive protection subsystem is integrated within BQ76952, which can monitor a variety of parameters, 
initiate protective actions, and autonomously recover based on conditions. The device also includes a wide 
range of flexibility, such that the device can be configured to monitor and initiate protective action, but 
with recovery controlled by the host processor, or such that the device only monitors and alerts the host 
processor whenever conditions warrant protective action, but with action and recovery fully controlled by the host 
processor.
The primary protection subsystem includes a suite of individual protections which can be individually enabled 
and configured, including cell undervoltage and overvoltage, overcurrent in charge, three separate overcurrent 
in discharge protections, short circuit current in discharge, cell overtemperature and undertemperature in charge 
and discharge, FET overtemperature, a host processor communication watchdog timeout, and PRECHARGE 
mode timeout. The cell undervoltage and overvoltage, overcurrent in charge, overcurrent in discharge 1 and 2, 
and short circuit in discharge protections are based on comparator thresholds, while the remaining protections 
(such as those involving temperature, host watchdog, and precharging) are based on firmware on the internal 
controller.
The device integrates NFET drivers for high-side CHG and DSG protection FETs, which can be configured 
in a series or parallel configuration. An integrated charge pump generates a voltage which is driven onto the 
NFET gates based on host command or the on-chip protection subsystem settings. Support is also included for 
high-side PFETs used to implement a precharge and predischarge functionality.
The secondary protection suite within the BQ76952 device can react to more serious faults and take 
action to permanently disable the pack, by initiating a Permanent Fail (PF). The secondary safety provides 
protection against safety cell undervoltage and overvoltage, safety overcurrent in charge and discharge, safety 
overtemperature for cells and FETs, excessive cell voltage imbalance, internal memory faults, and internal 
diagnostic failures.
When a Permanent Fail has occurred, the BQ76952 device can be configured to either simply provide a flag, or 
to indefinitely disable the protection FETs, or to assert the FUSE pin to permanently disable the pack. The FUSE 
pin can be used to blow an in-line fuse and also can monitor if a separate secondary protector IC has attempted 
to blow the fuse.
11.2 Primary Protections
The BQ76952 device integrates a broad suite of protections for battery management and provides the capability 
to enable individual protections, as well as to select which protections will result in autonomous control of the 
FETs. See the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual  for detailed descriptions of each protection function. The 
primary protection features include:
•Cell Undervoltage Protection
•Cell Overvoltage Protection
•Cell Overvoltage Latch Protection
•Overcurrent in Charge Protection
•Overcurrent in Discharge Protection (three tiers)
•Overcurrent in Discharge Latch Protection
•Short Circuit in Discharge Protection
•Short Circuit in Discharge Latch Protection

•Host Watchdog Fault Protection
11.3 Secondary Protections
The BQ76952 device integrates a suite of secondary protection checks on battery operation and status that can 
trigger a Permanent Fail (PF) if conditions are considered so serious that the pack should be permanently 
disabled. The various PF checks can be enabled individually based on configuration settings, along with 
associated thresholds and delays for most checks. When a Permanent Fail has occurred, the BQ76952 device 
can be configured to either simply provide a flag, to indefinitely disable the protection FETs, or to assert the 
FUSE pin to permanently disable the pack. The FUSE pin can be used to blow an in-line fuse and also can 
monitor if a separate secondary protector IC has attempted to blow the fuse.
Because the device stores Permanent Fail status in RAM, that status would be lost when the device resets. 
To mitigate this, the device can write Permanent Fail status to OTP based on configuration setting. OTP 
programming may be delayed in low-voltage and high-temperature conditions until OTP programming can 
reliably be accomplished.
Normally, a Permanent Fail causes the FETs to remain off indefinitely and the fuse may be blown. In that 
situation, no further action would be taken on further monitoring operations, and charging would no longer be 
possible. To avoid rapidly draining the battery, the device may be configured to enter DEEPSLEEP mode when 
a Permanent Fail occurs. Entrance to DEEPSLEEP mode will still be delayed until after fuse blow and OTP 
programming are completed, if those options are enabled.
When a Permanent Fail occurs, the device may be configured to either turn the REG1 and REG2 LDOs off, or to 
leave them in their present state. Once disabled, they may still be reenabled through command.
The Permanent Fail checks incorporate a programmable delay to avoid triggering a PF fault on an intermittent 
condition or measurement. When the threshold is first detected as being met or exceeded by an enabled PF 
check, the device will set a PF Alert signal, which can be monitored using commands and can also trigger an 
interrupt on the ALERT pin.
Note
The device only evaluates the conditions for Permanent Fail at one second intervals while in NORMAL 
and SLEEP modes, it does not continuously compare measurements to the Permanent Fail fault 
thresholds between intervals. Thus, it is possible for a condition to trigger a PF alert if detected 
over threshold, but even if the condition drops back below threshold briefly between the one second 
interval checks, the PF alert would not be cleared until it was detected below threshold at a periodic 
check.
For more details on the Permanent Fail checks implemented in the BQ76952, refer to the BQ76952 Technical 
Reference Manual . The secondary protection checks include:
•Safety Cell Undervoltage Permanent Fail
•Safety Cell Overvoltage Permanent Fail
•Safety Overcurrent in Charge Permanent Fail
•Safety Overcurrent in Discharge Permanent Fail

11.4 High-Side NFET Drivers
The BQ76952 device includes an integrated charge pump and high-side NFET drivers for driving CHG and DSG 
protection FETs. The charge pump uses an external capacitor connected between the BAT and CP1 pins that is 
charged to an overdrive voltage when the charge pump is enabled. Due to the time required for the charge pump 
to bring the overdrive voltage on the external CP1 pin to full voltage, it is recommended to leave the charge 
pump powered whenever it may be needed quickly to drive the CHG or DSG FETs.
The DSG FET driver includes a special option (denoted source follower mode) to drive the DSG FET with the 
BAT pin voltage during SLEEP mode. This capability is included to provide low power in SLEEP mode, when 
there is no significant charge or discharge current flowing. It is recommended to keep the charge pump enabled 
even when the source follower mode is enabled, so whenever a discharge current is detected, the device can 
quickly transition to driving the DSG FET using the charge pump voltage. The source follower mode is enabled 
using a configuration setting and is not intended to be used when significant charging or discharging current is 
flowing, since the FET will exhibit a large drain-source voltage and may undergo excessive heating.
The overdrive level of the charge pump voltage can be set to 5.5 V or 11 V, based on the configuration setting. 
In general, the 5.5-V setting results in lower power dissipation when a FET is being driven, while the higher 11-V 
overdrive reduces the on-resistance of the FET. If a FET exhibits significant gate leakage current when driven at 
the higher overdrive level, this can result in a higher device current for the charge pump to support this. In this 
case, using the lower overdrive level can reduce the leakage current and thus the device current.
The BQ76952 device supports a system with FETs in a series or parallel configuration, where the parallel 
configuration includes a separate path for the charger connection versus the discharge (load) connection. 
The control logic for the device operates slightly differently in these two cases, which is set based on the 
configuration setting.
The FET drivers in the BQ76952 device can be controlled in several different manner, depending on customer 
requirements:
Fully autonomous
The BQ76952 device can detect protection faults and autonomously disable the FETs, monitor for 
a recovery condition, and autonomously reenable the FETs, without requiring any host processor 
involvement.
Partially autonomous
The BQ76952 device can detect protection faults and autonomously disable the FETs. When the 
host receives an interrupt and recognizes the fault, the host can send commands across the digital 
communications interface to keep the FETs off until the host decides to release them.
Alternatively, the host can assert the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins to keep the FETs off. As long 
as these pins are asserted, the FETs are blocked from being reenabled. When these pins are 
deasserted, the BQ76952 will reenable the FETs if nothing is blocking them being reenabled (such 
as fault conditions still present, or the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins are asserted).

PAGE 45 of 87
================================================================================

The BQ76952 device can detect protection faults and provide an interrupt to a host processor 
over the ALERT pin. The host processor can read the status information of the fault over 
the communication bus (if desired) and can quickly force the CHG or DSG FETs off by 
driving the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins from the host processor, or commands over the digital 
communications interface.
When the host decides to allow the FETs to turn on again, it writes the appropriate command or 
deasserts the CFETOFF and DFETOFF pins, and the BQ76952 device will reenable the FETs if 
nothing is blocking them being reenabled.
11.5 Protection FETs Configuration and Control
11.5.1 FET Configuration
The BQ76952 device supports both a series configuration and a parallel configuration for the protection FETs in 
the system, as well as a system that does not use one or both FETs. When a series FET configuration is used, 
the BQ76952 device provides body diode protection for the case when one FET is off and one FET is on.
If the CHG FET is off, the DSG or PDSG FET is on, and a discharge current greater in magnitude than a 
programmable threshold (that is, a significant discharging current) is detected, the device will turn on the CHG 
FET, to avoid current flowing through the CHG FET body diode and damaging the FET. When the current rises 
above the threshold (that is, less discharge current flowing), the CHG FET will be turned off again if the reasons 
for its turn-off are still present.
If the DSG FET is off, the CHG or PCHG FET is on, and a current in excess of a programmable threshold 
(that is, a significant charging current) is detected, the device will turn on the DSG FET, to avoid current flowing 
through the DSG FET body diode and damaging the FET. When the current falls below the threshold (that is, 
less charging current flowing), the DSG FET will be turned off again if the reasons for its turn-off are still present.
When a parallel configuration is used, the body diode protection is disabled.
11.5.2 PRECHARGE and PREDISCHARGE Modes
The BQ76952 device includes precharge functionality, which can be used to reduce the charging current for 
an undervoltage battery by charging using a high-side PCHG PFET (driven from the PCHG pin) with series 
resistor until the battery reaches a programmable voltage level. When the minimum cell voltage is less than a 
programmable threshold, the PCHG FET will be used for charging.
The device also supports predischarge functionality, which can be used to reduce inrush current when the load is 
initially powered, by first enabling a high-side PDSG PFET (driven from the PDSG pin) with series resistor, which 
enables the load to slowly charge. If PREDISCHARGE mode is enabled, whenever the DSG FET is turned on to 
power the load, the device will first enable the PDSG FET, then transition to turn on the DSG FET and turn off 
the PDSG FET.
The PCHG and PDSG drivers are limited in the current they can sink while enabled. As such, it is recommended 
to use 1 MΩ or larger resistance across the FET gate-source.
11.6 Load Detect Functionality
When a Short Circuit in Discharge Latch or Overcurrent in Discharge Latch protection fault has occurred and the 
DSG FET is off, the device can be configured to recover when load removal is detected. This feature is useful if 
the system has a removable pack, such that the user can remove the pack from the system when a fault occurs, 
or if the effective system load that remains on the battery pack is higher than ~20-k Ω when the DSG FET is 
disabled. The device will periodically enable a current source out the LD pin and will recover the fault if a voltage 
is detected at the LD pin above a 4-V level. If a low-impedance load is still present on the pack, the voltage the 
device measures on the LD pin will generally be below 4-V, preventing recovery based on Load Detect. If the 
pack has been removed from the system and the effective load is high, such that the current source generates a 
voltage on the LD pin above a 4-V level, then the device can recover from the fault.www.ti.comBQ76952

Note
Typically, a 10-k Ω resistor is connected between the PACK+ terminal and the LD pin, this resistance 
should be comprehended when considering the load impedance. The Load Detect current is enabled 
for a programmable time duration, then is disabled for another programmable time duration, with this 
sequence repeating until the load has been detected as removed or it times out.
12 Device Hardware Features
12.1 Voltage References
The BQ76952 device includes two voltage references, V REF1 and V REF2, with V REF1 used by the voltage ADC for 
most measurements except external thermistors. V REF2 is used by the integrated 1.8 V LDO, internal oscillators, 
and integrated coulomb counter ADC. The value of V REF2 can be measured indirectly by the voltage ADC's 
measurement of the REG18 LDO voltage while using V REF1 for diagnostic purposes.
12.2 ADC Multiplexer
The ADC multiplexer connects various signals to the voltage ADC, including the individual differential cell voltage 
pins, the on-chip temperature sensor, the biased thermistor pins, the REG18 LDO voltage, the VSS pin voltage, 
and internal dividers connected to the VC16, PACK, and LD pins.
12.3 LDOs
The BQ76952 device contains an integrated 1.8-V LDO (REG18) that provides a regulated 1.8 V supply voltage 
for the device's internal circuitry and digital logic. This regulator uses an external capacitor connected to the 
REG18 pin, and it should only be used for internal circuitry.
The device also integrates two separately programmable LDOs (REG1 and REG2) for external circuitry, such 
as a host processor or external transceiver circuitry, which can be programmed to independent output voltages. 
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs take their input from the REGIN pin, with this voltage either provided externally or 
generated by an on-chip preregulator (referred to as REG0). The REG1 and REG2 LDOs can provide an output 
current of up to 45 mA each.
12.3.1 Preregulator Control
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs take their input from the REGIN pin, which should be approximately 5.5 V. This 
REGIN pin voltage can be supplied externally (such as by a separate DC/DC converter) or using the integrated 
voltage preregulator (referring to as REG0), which drives the base of an external NPN BJT (using the BREG pin) 
to provide the 5.5-V REGIN pin voltage. When the preregulator is being used, special care should be taken to 
ensure the device retains sufficient voltage on its BAT pin, per the specifications in Specifications .
Note
The system designer should ensure the external BJT can tolerate the peak power that may be 
dissipated in it under maximum load expected on REG1 and REG2. If the maximum stack voltage 
is 80 V, then the BJT will experience a collector-emitter voltage of approximately 75 V, thereby 
dissipating 6.75 W if REG1 and REG2 are both used to support a 45-mA load.
Note
There is a diode connection between the REGIN pin (anode) and the BAT pin (cathode), so the 
voltage on REGIN should not exceed the voltage on BAT.BQ76952

================================================================================

12.3.2 REG1 and REG2 LDO Controls
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs in the BQ76952 device are for customer use, and their output voltages can be 
programmed independently to 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.0 V, 3.3 V, or 5.0 V. The REG1 and REG2 LDOs and the REG0 
preregulator are disabled by default in the BQ76952 device. While in SHUTDOWN mode, the REG1 and REG2 
pins have ≈10-MΩ  resistances to VSS, to discharge any output capacitance. While in other power modes, 
when REG1 and REG2 are powered down, they are pulled to VSS with an internal resistance of ≈2.5-kΩ . If 
pullup resistors for serial communications are connected to the REG1 voltage output, the REG1 voltage can be 
overdriven from an external voltage supply on the manufacturing line, to allow communications with the device. 
The BQ76952 device can then be programmed to enable REG0 and REG1 with the desired configuration, and 
this setting can be programmed into OTP memory. Thus, at each later power-up, the device will autonomously 
load the OTP settings and enable the LDO as configured, without requiring communications first.
12.4 Standalone Versus Host Interface
The BQ76952 device can be configured to operate in a completely standalone mode, without any host processor 
in the system, or together with a host processor. If in standalone mode, the device can monitor conditions, 
control FETs and an in-line fuse based on threshold settings, and recover FETs when conditions allow, all 
without requiring any interaction with an external processor. If a host processor is present, the device can still be 
configured to operate fully autonomously, while the host processor can read measurements and exercise control 
as desired. In addition, the device can be configured for manual host control, such that the device can monitor 
and provide a flag when a protection alert or fault has occurred, but will rely on the host to disable FETs.
The host processor can interface with the BQ76952 device through a serial bus as well as selected pin controls. 
Serial bus communication through I2C (supporting speeds up to 400 kHz), SPI or HDQ is available, with the 
serial bus configured for I2C by default in the BQ76952, while the default communications mode may differ 
for other versions of the device. The pin controls available include RST_SHUT, ALERT, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, 
DDSG, and DCHG, which are described in detail below.
12.5 Multifunction Pin Controls
The BQ76952 device provides flexibility regarding the multifunction pins on the device, which includes the TS1, 
TS2, TS3, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, ALERT, HDQ, DCHG, and DDSG pins. Several of the pins can be used as 
active-high outputs with configurable output level. The digital output driver for these pins can be configured 
to drive an output powered from the REG1 LDO or from the internal REG18 LDO, and thus when asserted 
active-high will drive out the voltage of the selected LDO.
Note
The REG18 LDO is not capable of driving high current levels, so it is recommended to only use this 
LDO to provide a digital output if it will be driving a very high resistance (such as > 1 M Ω) or light 
capacitive load. Otherwise, the REG1 should be powered and used to drive the output signal.
The options supported on each pin include:
ALERT
Alarm interrupt output
HDQ communications
CFETOFF
Input to control the CHG FET (that is, CFETOFF functionality)
DFETOFF
Input to control the DSG FET (that is, DFETOFF functionality)
Input to control both the DSG and CHG FETs (that is, BOTHOFF functionality)

12.6 RST_SHUT Pin Operation
The RST_SHUT pin provides a simple way to reset or shutdown the BQ76952 device without needing to use 
serial bus communication. During normal operation, the RST_SHUT pin should be driven low. When the pin is 
driven high, the device will immediately reset most of the digital logic, including that associated with the serial 
communications bus. However, it does not reset the logic that holds the state of the protection FETs and FUSE, 
these remain as they were before the pin was driven high. If the pin continues to be driven high for 1 second, 
the device will then transition into SHUTDOWN mode, which involves disabling external protection FETs, and 
powering off the internal oscillators, the REG18 LDO, the on-chip preregulator, and the REG1 and REG2 LDOs.
12.7 CFETOFF, DFETOFF, and BOTHOFF Pin Functionality
The BQ76952 device includes two pins (CFETOFF and DFETOFF) which can be used to disable the protection 
FET drivers quickly, without going through the host serial communications interface. When the selected pin is 
asserted, the device disables the respective protection FET. Note: when the selected pin is deasserted, the 
respective FET will only be enabled if there are no other items blocking them being reenabled, such as if 
the host also sent a command to disable the FETs using the serial communications interface after setting the 
selected pin. Both the CFETOFF and DFETOFF pins can be used for other functions if the FET turnoff feature is 
not required.
The CFETOFF pin can optionally be used to disable the CHG and PCHG FETs, and the DFETOFF pin can 
optionally be used to disable the DSG and PDSG FETs. The device also includes the option to configure the 
DFETOFF pin as BOTHOFF functionality, such that if that pin is asserted, the CHG, PCHG, DSG, and PDSG 
FETs will be disabled. This allows the CFETOFF pin to be used for an additional thermistor in the system, while 
still providing pin control to disable the FETs.
The CFETOFF or BOTHOFF functionality disables both the CHG FET and the PCHG FET when asserted.
The DFETOFF or BOTHOFF functionality disables both the DSG FET and the PDSG FET when asserted.
12.8 ALERT Pin Operation
The ALERT pin is a multifunction pin that can be configured either as ALERT (to provide an interrupt to a 
host processor), a thermistor input, a general purpose ADC input, a general purpose digital output, or an 
HDQ serial communication interface. The pin can be configured as active-high, active-low, or open-drain, to BQ76952

================================================================================

accommodate different system design preferences. When configured as the HDQ interface pin, the pin will 
operate in open-drain mode.
When the pin is configured to drive an active high output, the output voltage is driven from either the REG18 1.8 
V LDO or the REG1 LDO (which can be programmed from 1.8 V to 5.0 V). Note: if a DC or significant transient 
current may be driven by this pin, then the output should be configured to drive using the REG1 LDO, not the 
REG18 LDO.
The BQ76952 device includes functionality to generate an alarm signal at the ALERT pin, which can be used 
as an interrupt to a host processor. When used for the alarm function, the pin can be programmed to drive 
the signal as an active-low or hi-Z signal, an active-high or low signal, or an active-low or high signal (that is, 
inverted polarity). The alarm function within the BQ76952 device includes a programmable mask, to allow the 
customer to decide which of many flags or events can trigger an alarm.
12.9 DDSG and DCHG Pin Operation
The BQ76952 device includes two multifunction pins, DDSG and DCHG, which can be configured as logic-level 
outputs to provide a fault-related signal to a host processor or external circuitry (that is, DDSG and DCHG 
functionality), as a thermistor input, a general purpose ADC input, or a general purpose digital output.
When used as a digital output, the pins can be configured to drive an active high output, with the output voltage 
driven from either the REG18 1.8-V LDO or the REG1 LDO (which can be programmed from 1.8 V to 5.0 V).
Note
If a DC or significant transient current may be driven by a pin, then the output should be configured to 
drive using the REG1 LDO, not the REG18 LDO.
When the pins are configured for DDSG and DCHG functionality, they provide signals related to protection faults 
that (on the DCHG pin) would normally cause the CHG driver to be disabled, or (on the DDSG pin) would 
normally cause the DSG driver to be disabled. These signals can be used to control external protection circuitry, 
if the integrated high-side NFET drivers will not be used in the system. They can also be used as interrupts in 
manual FET control mode for the host processor to decide whether to disable the FETs through commands or 
using the CFETOFF and DFETOFF pins.
12.10 Fuse Drive
The FUSE pin on the BQ76952 device can be used to blow a chemical fuse in the presence of a Permanent 
Fail (PF), as well as to determine if an external secondary protector in the system has detected a fault and 
is attempting to blow the fuse itself. The pin can drive the gate of an NFET, which can be combined with the 
drive from an external secondary protector, as shown in Figure 12-1 . When the FUSE pin is not asserted by the 
BQ76952 device, it remains in a high-impedance state and detects a voltage applied at the pin by a secondary 
protector. The device can be configured to generate a PF if it detects a high signal at the FUSE pin.
The device can be configured to blow the fuse when a PF occurs. In this case, the device will only attempt 
to blow the fuse if the stack voltage is above a programmed threshold, based on a system configuration with 
the fuse placed between the top of stack and the high-side protection FETs. If instead the fuse is placed 
between the FETs and the PACK+ connector, then the device bases its decision on the PACK pin voltage (based 
on configuration setting). This voltage threshold check may be disregarded under certain special cases, as 
described in the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual .www.ti.comBQ76952

12.11 Cell Open Wire
The BQ76952 device supports detection of a broken connection between a cell in the pack and the cell 
attachment to the PCB containing BQ76952. Without this check, the voltage at the cell input pin of the BQ76952 
device may persist for some time on the board-level capacitor, leading to incorrect voltage readings. The Cell 
Open Wire detection in the BQ76952 device operates by enabling a small current source from each cell to VSS 
at programmable intervals. If a cell input pin is floating due to an open wire condition, this current discharges the 
capacitance, causing the voltage at the pin to slowly drop. This drop in voltage eventually triggers a protection 
fault on that particular cell and the cell above it. Eventually, the voltage drops low enough to trigger a Permanent 
Fail on the particular cell and the cell above it.
The Cell Open Wire current is enabled at a periodic interval set by configuration register. The current source 
is enabled once every interval for a duration of the ADC measurement time (which is 3 ms by default). This 
provides programmability in the average current drawn from ≈0.65 nA to ≈165 nA, based on the typical current 
level of 55 µA.
Note
The Cell Open Wire check can create a cell imbalance, so the settings should be selected 
appropriately.
12.12 Low Frequency Oscillator
The low frequency oscillator (LFO) in the BQ76952 device operates continuously while in NORMAL and SLEEP 
modes, and can be configured to remain powered or shutdown (except when needed) during DEEPSLEEP 
mode. The LFO runs at ≈262.144 kHz during NORMAL mode, and reduces to ≈32.768 kHz in SLEEP 
or DEEPSLEEP modes. The LFO is trimmed during manufacturing to meet the specified accuracy across 
temperature.
12.13 High Frequency Oscillator
The high frequency oscillator (HFO) in the BQ76952 device operates at 16.78 MHz and is frequency locked to 
the LFO. The HFO powers up as needed for internal logic functions.BQ76952

13 Device Functional Modes
13.1 Overview
This device supports four functional modes to support optimized features and power dissipation, with the device 
able to transition between modes either autonomously or controlled by a host processor.
•NORMAL mode: In this mode, the device performs frequent measurements of system current, cell voltages, 
internal and thermistor temperature, and various other voltages, operates protections as configured, and 
provides data and status updates.
•SLEEP mode: In this mode, the DSG FET is enabled, the CHG FET can optionally be disabled, and 
the device performs measurements, calculations, and data updates in adjustable time intervals. Battery 
protections are still enabled. Between the measurement intervals, the device is operating in a reduced power 
stage to minimize total average current consumption.
•DEEPSLEEP mode: In this mode, the CHG, PCHG, DSG, and PDSG FETs are disabled, all battery 
protections are disabled, and no current or voltage measurements are taken. The REG1 and REG2 LDOs 
can be kept powered, in order to maintain power to external circuitry, such as a host processor.
•SHUTDOWN mode: The device is completely disabled (including the internal, REG1, and REG2 LDOs), 
the CHG, PCHG, DSG, and PDSG FETs are all disabled, all battery protections are disabled, and no 
measurements are taken. This is the lowest power state of the device, which may be used for shipment or 
long-term storage. All register settings are lost when in SHUTDOWN mode.
The device also includes a CONFIG_UPDATE mode, which is used for parameter updates. Transitioning 
between functional modes is shown below.

13.2 NORMAL Mode
NORMAL mode is the highest performance mode of the device, in which the device is making regular 
measurement of voltage, current, and temperature, the LFO (low frequency oscillator) is operating, and the 
internal processor powers up (as needed) for data processing and control. Full battery protections are operating, 
based on device configuration settings. System current is measured at intervals of 3 ms, with cell voltages 
measured at intervals of 63 ms or slower, depending on configuration. The device also provides a configuration www.ti.comBQ76952

bit which causes the conversion speed for both voltages and CC2 Current to be doubled, with a reduction in 
measurement resolution.
The device will generally be in NORMAL mode whenever any active charging or discharging is underway. When 
the CC1 Current measurement falls below a programmable current threshold, the system is considered in relax 
mode, and the BQ76952 device can autonomously transition into SLEEP mode, depending on the configuration.
13.3 SLEEP Mode
SLEEP mode is a reduced functionality state that can be optionally used to reduce power dissipation when 
there is little or no system load current or charging in progress, but still provides voltage at the battery pack 
terminals to keep the system alive. At initial power up, a configuration bit determines whether the device can 
enter SLEEP mode. After initialization, SLEEP mode can be allowed or disallowed using subcommands. Status 
bits are provided to indicate whether the device is presently allowed to enter SLEEP mode or not, and whether it 
is presently in SLEEP mode or not.
When the magnitude of the CC1 Current measurement falls below a programmable current threshold, the 
system is considered in relax mode, and the BQ76952 device will autonomously transition into SLEEP mode, 
if settings permit. During SLEEP mode, comparator-based protections operate the same as during NORMAL 
mode. ADC-based current, voltage, and temperature measurements are taken at programmable intervals. All 
temperature protections use the ADC measurements taken at these intervals, so they will update at a reduced 
rate during SLEEP mode.
The BQ76952 device will exit SLEEP mode if a protection fault occurs, or current begins flowing, or a charger 
is attached, or if forced by subcommand, or if the RST_SHUT pin is asserted for < 1 s. When exiting based on 
current flow, the device will quickly enable the FETs (if the CHG FET was off, or the DSG FET was in source 
follower mode), but the standard measurement loop is not restarted until the next 1-s boundary occurs within the 
device timing. Therefore, new data may not be available for up to ≈1-s after the device exits SLEEP mode.
The coulomb counter ADC operates in a reduced power and speed mode to monitor current during SLEEP 
mode. The current is measured every 12 ms and, if it exceeds a programmable threshold in magnitude, the 
device quickly transitions back to NORMAL mode. In addition to this check, if the CC1 Current measurement 
taken at each programmed interval exceeds this threshold, the device will exit SLEEP mode.
The device monitors the PACK pin voltage and the top-of-stack voltage at each programmed measurement 
interval. If the PACK pin voltage is higher than the top-of-stack voltage by more than a programmable delta and 
the top-of-stack voltage is less than a programmed threshold, the device will exit SLEEP mode. The BQ76952 
device also includes a hysteresis on the SLEEP mode entrance, in order to avoid the device quickly entering and 
exiting SLEEP mode based on a dynamic load. After transitioning to NORMAL mode, the device will not enter 
SLEEP mode again for a number of seconds given by the hysteresis setting.
During SLEEP mode, the DSG FET can be driven either using the charge pump or in source-follower mode, 
as described in Section 11.4. The CHG FET can be disabled or driven using the charge pump, based on the 
configuration setting.
13.4 DEEPSLEEP Mode
The BQ76952 device integrates a DEEPSLEEP mode, which is a low power mode that allows the REG1 and 
REG2 LDOs to remain powered, but disables other subsystems. In this mode, the protection FETs are all 
disabled, so no voltage is provided at the battery pack terminals. All protections are disabled, and all voltage, 
current, and temperature measurements are disabled.
DEEPSLEEP mode can be entered by sending a subcommand over the serial communications interface. The 
device will exit DEEPSLEEP mode and return to NORMAL mode if directed by a subcommand, or if the 
RST_SHUT pin is asserted for < 1 second, or if a charger is attached (which is detected by the voltage on 
the LD pin rising from below V WAKEONLD  to exceed it). In addition, if the BAT pin voltage falls below V PORA  – 
VPORA_HYS , the device transitions to SHUTDOWN mode.
When the device exits DEEPSLEEP mode, it first completes a full measurement loop and evaluates conditions 
relative to enabled protections, to ensure that conditions are acceptable to proceed to NORMAL mode. This may 
take ≈250 ms plus the time for the measurement loop to complete.BQ76952

================================================================================
PAGE 53 of 87
================================================================================

The REG1 and REG2 LDOs will maintain their power state when entering DEEPSLEEP mode based on the 
configuration setting. The device also provides the ability to keep the LFO running while in DEEPSLEEP mode, 
which allows for a faster responsiveness to communications and transition back to NORMAL mode, but will 
consume additional power.
Other than sending a subcommand to exit DEEPSLEEP mode, communications with the device over the serial 
interface will not cause it to exit DEEPSLEEP mode. However, since no measurements are taken while in 
DEEPSLEEP mode, there is no new information available for readout.
13.5 SHUTDOWN Mode
SHUTDOWN mode is the lowest power mode of the BQ76952, which can be used for shipping or long-term 
storage. In this mode, the device loses all register state information, the internal logic is powered down, 
the protection FETs are all disabled, so no voltage is provided at the battery pack terminals. All protections 
are disabled, all voltage, current, and temperature measurements are disabled, and no communications are 
supported. When the device exits SHUTDOWN, it will boot and read parameters stored in OTP (if that has been 
written). If the OTP has not been written, the device will power up with default settings, and then settings can be 
changed by the host writing device registers.
Entering SHUTDOWN mode involves a sequence of steps. The sequence can be initiated manually through the 
serial communications interface. The device can also be configured to enter SHUTDOWN mode automatically 
based on the top of stack voltage or the minimum cell voltage. If the top-of-stack voltage falls below a 
programmed stack voltage threshold, or if the minimum cell voltage falls below a programmed cell voltage 
threshold, the SHUTDOWN mode sequence is automatically initiated. The shutdown based on cell voltage does 
not apply to cell input pins being used to measure interconnect.
While the BQ76952 device is in NORMAL mode or SLEEP mode, the device can also be configured to enter 
SHUTDOWN mode if the internal temperature measurement exceeds a programmed temperature threshold for a 
programmed delay.
When the SHUTDOWN mode sequence has been initiated by subcommand or the RST_SHUT pin driven high 
for 1-sec, the device will wait for a delay then disable the protection FETs. After the delay from when the 
sequence begins, the device will enter SHUTDOWN mode. However, if the voltage on the LD pin is still above 
the V WAKEONLD  level, shutdown will be delayed until the voltage on LD falls below that level.
While the device is in SHUTDOWN mode, a ≈5 V voltage is provided at the TS2 pin with high source impedance. 
If the TS2 pin is pulled low, such as by a switch to VSS, or if a voltage is applied at the LD pin above V WAKEONLD 
(such as when a charger is attached in series FET configuration), the device will exit SHUTDOWN mode. 
Note: if a thermistor is attached from the TS2 pin to VSS, this may prevent the device from ever fully entering 
SHUTDOWN mode.
As a countermeasure to avoid an unintentional wake from SHUTDOWN mode when putting the BQ76952 
device into long-term storage, the device can be configured to automatically reenter SHUTDOWN mode after a 
programmed number of minutes.
The BQ76952 device performs periodic memory integrity checks and will force a watchdog reset if any corruption 
is detected. To avoid a cycle of resets in the case of a memory fault, the device will enter SHUTDOWN mode 
rather than resetting if a memory error is detected within a programmed number of seconds after a watchdog 
reset has occurred.
When the device is wakened from SHUTDOWN, it generally requires approximately 200-300 ms for the internal 
circuitry to power up, load settings from OTP memory, perform initial measurements, evaluate those relative to 
enabled protections, then to enable FETs if conditions allow. This can be much longer depending on settings.
The BQ76952 device integrates a hardware overtemperature detection circuit, which determines when the die 
temperature passes an excessive temperature of approximately 120°C. If this detector triggers, the device will 
automatically begin the sequence to enter SHUTDOWN if this functionality is enabled through configuration.www.ti.comBQ76952

13.6 CONFIG_UPDATE Mode
The BQ76952 device uses a special CONFIG_UPDATE mode to make changes to the data memory settings. If 
changes were made to the data memory settings while the firmware was in normal operation, it could result in 
an unexpected operation or consequences if settings used by the firmware changed in the midst of operation. 
When changes to the data memory settings are needed (which generally should only be done on the customer 
manufacturing line or in an offline condition), the host should put the device into CONFIG_UPDATE mode, 
modify settings as required, then exit CONFIG_UPDATE mode. See the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual 
for more details.
When in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, the device stops normal firmware operation and stops all measurements and 
protection monitoring. The host can then make changes to data memory settings (either writing registers directly 
into RAM, or instructing the device to program the RAM data into OTP). After changes are complete, the host 
then exits CONFIG_UPDATE mode, at which point the device restarts normal firmware operation using the new 
data memory settings.
14 Serial Communications Interface
14.1 Serial Communications Overview
The BQ76952 device integrates three serial communication interfaces - an I2C bus, which supports 100 kHz 
and 400 kHz modes with an optional CRC check, an SPI bus with an optional CRC check, and a single-wire 
HDQ interface. The BQ76952 device is configured default in I2C mode, while other versions of the device may 
have a different default configuration (such as the BQ7695201 device, which by default is configured in SPI 
mode with CRC enabled). The communication mode can be changed by programming either the register or 
OTP configuration. The customer can program the device's integrated OTP on the manufacturing line to set the 
desired communications speed and protocol to be used at power up in operation.
14.2 I2C Communications
The I2C serial communications interface in the BQ76952 device acts as a responder device and supports rates 
up to 400 kHz with an optional CRC check. If the OTP is not programmed, the BQ76952 device will initially 
power up by default in 400 kHz I2C mode, although other versions of the device may initially power up in 
a different mode (as described in the Device Comparison Table . The OTP setting can be programmed on 
the manufacturing line, then when the device powers up, it automatically enters the selected mode per OTP 
setting. The host can also change the I2C speed setting while in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, then the new speed 
setting takes effect upon exit of CONFIG_UPDATE mode. Alternatively, the host can use the SWAP_TO_I2C() 
subcommand to change the communications interface to I2C immediately.
The I2C device address (as an 8-bit value including responder address and R/W bit) is set by default as 0x10 
(write), 0x11 (read), which can be changed by configuration setting.
The communications interface includes programmable timeout capability. This should only be used if the bus will 
be operating at 100 kHz or 400 kHz. If this is enabled with the device set to 100-kHz mode, then the device will 
reset the communications interface logic if a clock is detected low longer than a t TIMEOUT  of 25 ms to 35 ms, or if 
the cumulative clock low responder extend time exceeds ≈25 ms, or if the cumulative clock low controller extend 
time exceeds 10 ms. If the timeouts are enabled with the device set to 400-kHz mode, then the device will reset 
the communications interface logic if a clock is detected low longer than t TIMEOUT  of 5 ms to 20 ms. The bus also 
includes a long-term timeout if the SCL pin is detected low for more than 2 seconds, which applies whether or 
not the timeouts above are enabled.
Figure 14-1  shows an I2C write transaction. Block writes are allowed by sending additional data bytes before the 
Stop. The I2C logic will auto-increment the register address after each data byte.
When enabled, the CRC is calculated as follows:
•In a single-byte write transaction, the CRC is calculated over the responder address, register address, and 
data.
•In a block write transaction, the CRC for the first data byte is calculated over the responder address, register 
address, and data. The CRC for subsequent data bytes is calculated over the data byte only.BQ76952

The CRC polynomial is x8 + x2 + x + 1, and the initial value is 0. 
When the responder detects an invalid CRC, the I2C responder NACKs the CRC, which causes the I2C 
responder to go to an idle state.

Figure 14-3  shows a read transaction where a Repeated Start is not used; for example, if not available in 
hardware. For a block read, the controller ACKs each data byte except the last and continues to clock the 
interface. The I2C block auto-increments the register address after each data byte.
When enabled, the CRC for a read transaction is calculated as follows:
•In a single-byte read transaction, the CRC is calculated beginning at the first start, so includes the responder 
address, the register address, then the responder address with a read bit set, then the data byte.
•In a block read transaction, the CRC for the first data byte is calculated beginning at the first start and will 
include the responder address, the register address, then the responder address with a read bit set, then the 
data byte. The CRC resets after each data byte and after each stop. The CRC for subsequent data bytes is 
calculated over the data byte only.
The CRC polynomial is x8 + x2 + x + 1, and the initial value is 0.
When the controller detects an invalid CRC, the I2C controller will NACK the CRC, which causes the I2C 
responder to go to an idle state.www.ti.comBQ76952

14.3 SPI Communications
The SPI interface in the BQ76952 device operates as a responder-only interface with an optional CRC check. 
If the OTP has not been programmed, the BQ76952 device initially powers up by default in 400 kHz I2C mode, 
while other device versions will initially powerup by default in SPI mode with CRC enabled, as described in 
the Device Comparison Table . The OTP setting to select SPI mode can be programmed into the BQ76952 
on the manufacturing line, then when the device powers up, it automatically enters SPI mode. The host can 
also change the serial communication setting while in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, although the device will not 
immediately change communication mode upon exit of CONFIG_UPDATE mode to avoid losing communications 
during evaluation or production. The host can reset the device or write the SWAP_TO_SPI()  subcommand to 
change the communications interface to SPI immediately.
The SPI interface logic operates with clock polarity (CPOL) = 0 and clock phase (CPHA) = 0, as shown in the 
figure below.

Figure 14-4. SPI with CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 0
The device also includes an optional 8-bit CRC using polynomial x8+x2+x+1. The interface must use 16-bit 
transactions if CRC is not enabled, and must use 24-bit transactions when CRC is enabled. CRC mode is 
enabled or disabled based on the setting of Settings:Configuration:Comm Type . Based on configuration 
settings, the logic will:
(a) Only work with CRC, will not accept data without valid CRC, or
(b) Only accept transactions without CRC (so the host must only clock 16-bits per transaction, the device will 
detect an error if more or less clocks are sent).
If the host performs a write with CRC and the CRC is not correct, then the incoming data is not transferred to the 
incoming buffer, and the outgoing buffer (used for the next transaction) is also reset to 0xFFFF. This transaction BQ76952

================================================================================
PAGE 57 of 87
================================================================================

is considered invalid. On the next transaction, the CRC (if clocked out) will be 0xAA, so the 0xFFFFAA will 
indicate to the controller that a CRC error was detected.
The internal oscillator in the BQ76952 device may not be running when the host initiates a transaction (for 
example, this can occur if the device is in SLEEP mode). If this occurs, the interface will drive out 0xFFFF on 
SPI_MISO for the first 16-bits clocked out. It will also drive out 0xFF for the third (CRC) byte as well, if CRC is 
enabled. So the 0xFFFF or 0xFFFFFF will indicate to the controller that the internal oscillator is not ready yet.
The device will automatically wake the internal oscillator at a falling edge of SPI_CS, but it may take up to 50 µs 
to stabilize and be available for use to the SPI interface logic. The address 0x7F used in the device is defined 
in such a manner that there should be no valid transaction to write 0xFF into this address. Thus the two-byte 
pattern 0xFFFF should never occur as a valid sequence in the first two bytes of a transaction (that is, it is only 
used as a flag that something is wrong, similar to an I2C NACK).
Due to the delay in the HFO powering up if initially off, the device includes a programmable hysteresis to cause 
the HFO to stay powered for a programmable number of seconds after it is wakened by a falling edge on 
SPI_CS. This hysteresis is controlled by the Settings:Configuration:Comm Idle Time  configuration setting, 
which can be set from 0 to 255 seconds (while in SPI mode, the device will use a minimum hysteresis of 1 
second even if the value is set to 0). The host can set this to a longer time (up to 255 seconds) and maintain 
regular communications within this time window, causing the HFO to stay powered, so the device can respond 
quickly to SPI transactions. However, keeping the HFO running continuously will cause the device to consume 
additional supply current beyond what it would consume if the HFO were only powered when needed (the HFO 
draws ≈30 µA when powered). To avoid this extra supply current, the host can send an initial, unnecessary SPI 
transaction to cause the HFO to waken, and retry this until a valid response is returned on SPI_MISO. At this 
point, the host can begin sending the intended SPI transactions.
If an excessive number of SPI transactions occur over a long period of time, the device may experience a 
watchdog fault. It is recommended to limit the frequency of SPI transactions by providing 50 μs or more from the 
end of one transaction to the start of a new transaction.
The device includes ability to detect a frozen or disconnected SPI bus condition, and it will then reset the bus 
logic. This condition is recognized when the SPI_CS is low and the SPI_SCLK is static and not changing for a 
two second timeout.
Depending on the version of the device being used, the SPI_MISO pin may be configured by default 
to use the REG18 LDO for its output drive, which will result in a 1.8-V signal level. This may cause 
communications errors if the host processor operates with a higher voltage, such as 3.3 V or 5 V. The 
SPI_MISO pin can be programmed to instead use the REG1 LDO for its output drive by setting the 
Settings:Configuration:SPI Configuration[MISO_REG1]  data memory configuration bit. This bit should 
only be set if the REG1 LDO is powered. After this bit has been modified, it is necessary to send the 
SWAP_TO_SPI()  or SWAP_COMM_MODE()  subcommands for the device to use the new value.
The device includes optional pin filtering on the SPI input pins, which implements a filter with approximately 
200 ns delay on each input pin. This filtering is enabled by default but can be disabled by clearing the 
Settings:Configuration:SPI Configuration[FILT]  data memory configuration bit.
14.3.1 SPI Protocol
The first byte of a SPI transaction consists of an R/W bit (R = 0, W = 1), followed by a 7-bit address, MSB first. 
If the controller (host) is writing, then the second byte is the data written. If the controller is reading, then the 
second byte sent on SPI_MOSI is ignored (except for CRC calculation).
If CRC is enabled, then the controller must send as the third byte the 8-bit CRC code, which is calculated over 
the first two bytes. If the CRC is correct, then the values clocked in will be put into the incoming buffer. If the 
CRC is not correct, then the outgoing buffer is set to 0xFFFF, and the outgoing CRC is set to 0xAA (these are 
clocked out on the next transaction).
During this transaction, the logic clocks out the contents of the outgoing buffer. If the outgoing buffer was not 
updated since the last transaction, then the logic will clock out 0xFFFF; and if the CRC is clocked, it will clock out 
0x00 for the CRC (if enabled). Thus, the 0xFFFF00 command indicates to the controller that the outgoing buffer www.ti.comBQ76952

was not updated by the internal logic before the transaction occurred. This can occur when the device did not 
have sufficient time to update the buffer between consecutive transactions.
When the internal logic takes the write-data from the interface logic and processes it, it also causes the R/W bit, 
address, and data to be copied into the outgoing buffer. On the next transaction, this data is clocked back to the 
controller.
When the controller is initiating a read, the internal logic puts the R/W bit and address into the outgoing buffer, 
along with the data requested. The interface computes the CRC on the two bytes in the outgoing buffer and 
clocks that back to the controller if CRC is enabled (with the exceptions associated with 0xFFFF, as noted 
above). Below are diagrams of three transaction sequences with and without CRC, assuming CPOL = 0.

The time required for the device to process commands and subcommands will differ based on the specifics 
of each. The direct commands generally will complete within 50 μs, while subcommands can take longer, with 
different subcommands requiring different duration to complete. For example, when a particular subcommand is 
sent, the device requires approximately 200 μs to load the 32-byte data into the internal subcommand buffer. 
If the host provides sufficient time for this load to complete before beginning to read the buffer (readback from 
addresses 0x40 to 0x5F), the device will respond with valid data, rather than 0xFFFF00. When data has already 
been loaded into the subcommand buffer, this data can be read back with approximately 50 μs interval between 
SPI transactions. More detail regarding the approximate time duration required for specific commands and 
subcommands is provided in the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual  (SLUUBY2) .
The host software should incorporate a scheme to retry transactions that may not be successful. For example, 
if the device returns 0xFFFFFF on SPI_MISO, then the internal clock was not powered, and the transaction 
will need to be retried. Similarly, if the device returns 0xFFFFAA on a transaction, this indicates the previous 
transaction encountered a CRC error, and so the previous transaction must be retried. And as described above, 
if the device returns 0xFFFF00, then the previous transaction had not completed when the present transaction 
was sent, which may mean the previous transaction should be retried, or at least needs more time to complete.
14.4 HDQ Communications
The HDQ interface is an asynchronous return-to-one protocol where a processor communicates with the 
BQ76952 device using a single-wire connection to the ALERT pin or the HDQ pin, depending on the 
configuration. The controller (host device) and the responder (the BQ76952 device) drive the HDQ interface 
using an open-drain driver with a pullup resistor from the HDQ interface to a supply voltage required on 
the circuit board. The BQ76952 device can be changed from the default communication mode to HDQ 
communication mode by setting the Settings:Configuration:Comm Type  configuration register or by sending a 
subcommand (at which point the device switches to HDQ mode immediately).BQ76952

PAGE 63 of 87
================================================================================

Note
The SWAP_COMM_MODE()  subcommand immediately changes the communications interface to that 
selected by the Comm Type  configuration, while the SWAP_TO_HDQ()  subcommand immediately 
changes the interface to HDQ using the ALERT pin.
With HDQ, the least significant bit (LSB) of a data byte (command) or word (data) is transmitted first.
The 8-bit command code consists of two fields: the 7-bit HDQ command code (bits 0–6) and the 1-bit R/W field 
(MSB Bit 7). The R/W field directs the device to do one of the following:
•Accept the next 8 bits as data from the host to the device or
•Output 8 bits of data from the device to the host in response to the 7-bit command.
The HDQ peripheral on the BQ76952 device can transmit and receive data as an HDQ responder only.
The return-to-one data bit frame of HDQ consists of the following sections:
1.The first section is used to start the transmission by the host sending a Break (the host drives the HDQ 
interface to a logic-low state for a time t (B)) followed by a Break Recovery (the host releases the HDQ 
interface for a time t (BR)).
2.The next section is for host command transmission, where the host transmits 8 bits by driving the HDQ 
interface for 8 T (CYCH)  time slots. For each time slot, the HDQ line is driven low for a time T (HW0)  (host 
writing a "0") or T (HW1)  (host writing a "1"). The HDQ pin is then released and remains high to complete each 
T(CYCH)  time slot.
3.The next section is for data transmission where the host (if a write was initiated) or device (if a read was 
initiated) transmits 8 bits by driving the HDQ interface for 8 T (CYCH)  (if host is driving) or T (CYCD)  (if device 
is driving) time slots. The HDQ line is driven low for a time T (HW0)  (host writing a "0"), T (HW1)  (host writing a 
"1"), T (DW0)  (device writing a "0"), or T (DW1)  (device writing a "1"). The HDQ pin is then released and remains 
high to complete the time slot. The HDQ interface does not auto-increment, so a separate transaction must 
be sent for each byte to be transferred.
15 Cell Balancing
15.1 Cell Balancing Overview
The BQ76952 device supports passive cell balancing by bypassing the current of a selected cell during charging 
or at rest, using either integrated bypass switches between cells, or external bypass FET switches. The device 
incorporates a voltage-based balancing algorithm which can optionally balance cells autonomously without 
requiring any interaction with a host processor. Or if preferred, balancing can be entirely controlled manually 
from a host processor. For autonomous balancing, the device will only balance non-adjacent cells in use (it 
does not consider inputs used to measure interconnect as cells in use). To avoid excessive power dissipation 
within the BQ76952 device, the maximum number of cells allowed to balance simultaneously can be limited 
by configuration setting. For host-controlled balancing, adjacent as well as non-adjacent cells can be balanced. 
Host-controlled balancing can be controlled using specific subcommands sent by the host. The device also 
returns status information regarding how long cells have been balanced through subcommands.
When host-controlled balancing is initiated using subcommands, the device starts a timer and will continue 
balancing until the timer reaches a programmed value, or a new balancing subcommand is issued (which resets 
the timer). This is included as a precaution, in case the host processor initiated balancing but then stopped 
communication with the BQ76952 device, so that balancing would not continue indefinitely.
The BQ76952 device can automatically balance cells using a voltage-based algorithm based on environmental 
and system conditions. Several settings are provided to control when balancing is allowed, which are described 
in detail in the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual .
Due to the current that flows into the cell input pins on the BQ76952 device while balancing is active, the 
measurement of cell voltages and evaluation of cell voltage protections by the device is modified during 
balancing. Balancing is temporarily disabled during the regular measurement loop while the actively balanced 
cell is being measured by the ADC, as well as when the cells immediately adjacent to the active cell are being 
measured. Similarly, balancing on the top cell is disabled while the stack voltage measurement is underway. www.ti.comBQ76952

================================================================================

This occurs on every measurement loop, and so can result in significant reduction in the average balancing 
current that flows. To help alleviate this, additional configuration bits are provided which cause the device to 
slow the measurement loop speed when cell balancing is active. The BQ76952 device will insert current-only 
measurements after each voltage and a temperature scan loop to slow down voltage measurements and thereby 
increase the average balancing current.
The device includes an internal die temperature check, to disable balancing if the die temperature exceeds a 
programmable threshold. However, the customer should still carefully analyze the thermal effect of the balancing 
on the device in system. Based on the planned ambient temperature of the device during operation and the 
thermal properties of the package, the maximum power should be calculated that can be dissipated within 
the device and still ensure operation remains within the recommended operating temperature range. The cell 
balancing configuration can then be determined such that the device power remains below this level by limiting 
the maximum number of cells that can be balanced simultaneously, or by reducing the balancing current of each 
cell by appropriate selection of the external resistance in series with each cell.
16 Application and Implementation
Note
Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and 
TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining 
suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design 
implementation to confirm system functionality.
16.1 Application Information
The BQ76952 device can be used with 3-series to 16-series battery packs, supporting a top-of-stack voltage 
ranging from 5 V up to 80 V. To design and implement a comprehensive set of parameters for a specific 
battery pack, during development customers can use the Battery Management Studio ( BQSTUDIO ), which is 
a graphical user-interface tool installed on a PC. Using BQSTUDIO, the device can be configured for specific 
application requirements during development once the system parameters, such as fault trigger thresholds for 
protection, enable or disable of certain features for operation, configuration of cells, and more are known. This 
results in a "golden image" of settings that can then be programmed into the device registers or OTP memory.
16.2 Typical Applications
A simplified application schematic for a 16-series battery pack is shown in Figure 16-1 , using the BQ76952 
together with an external secondary protector, a host microcontroller, and a communications transceiver. This 
configuration uses CHG and DSG FETs in series, together with high-side PFET devices used to implement 
precharge and predischarge functionality. Several points to consider in an implementation are included below:
•The external NPN BJT used for the REGIN preregulator can be configured with its collector routed either to 
the cell battery stack or the middle of the protection FETs.
•A diode is recommended in the drain circuit of the external NPN BJT, which avoids reverse current flow from 
the BREG pin through the BJT base to collector in the event of a pack short circuit. This diode can be a 
Schottky diode if low voltage pack operation is needed, or a conventional diode can be used otherwise.
•A series diode is recommended at the BAT pin, together with a capacitor from the pin to VSS. These 
components allow the device to continue operating for a short time when a pack short circuit occurs, which 
may cause the PACK+ and top-of-stack voltages to drop to approximately 0 V. In this case, the diode 
prevents the BAT pin from being pulled low with the stack, and the device will continue to operate, drawing 
current from the capacitor. Generally operation is only required for a short time, until the device detects the 
short circuit event and disables the DSG FET. A Schottky diode can be used if low voltage pack operation is 
needed, or a conventional diode can be used otherwise.
•The diode in the BAT connection and the diode in the BJT collector should not be shared, since then the 
REG0 circuit might discharge the capacitor on BAT too quickly during a short circuit event.BQ76952

•The recommended voltage range on the VC0 to VC4 pins extends to –0.2 V. This can be used, for example, 
to measure a differential voltage that extends slightly below ground, such as the voltage across a second 
sense resistor in parallel with that connected to the SRP and SRN pins.
•If a system does not use high-side protection FETs, then the PACK pin can be connected through a series 
10-kΩ resistor to the top of stack. The LD pin can be connected to VSS. In this case, the LD pin can also be 
controlled separately, in order to wake the device from SHUTDOWN mode, such as through external circuitry 
which holds the LD pin at the voltage of VSS while the device stays in SHUTDOWN, and to be driven above 
a voltage of V WAKEONLD  in order to wake from SHUTDOWN.
•TI recommends using 100 Ω resistors in series with the SRP and SRN pins, and a 100 nF with optional 100 
pF differential filter capacitance between the pins for filtering. The routing of these components, together with 
the sense resistor, to the pins should be minimized and fully symmetric, with all components recommended 
to stay on the same side of the PCB with the device. Optional 0.1-μF filter capacitors can be added for 
additional noise filtering at each sense input pin to VSS.
•Due to thermistors often being attached to cells and possibly needing long wires to connect back to the 
device, it may be helpful to add a capacitor from the thermistor pin to the device VSS. However, it is important 
to not use too large of a value of capacitor, since this will affect the settling time when the thermistor is 
biased and measured periodically. A rule of thumb is to keep the time constant of the circuit < 5% of the 
measurement time. When Settings:Configuration:Power Config[FASTADC]  = 0, the measurement time is 
approximately 3 ms, and with [FASTADC]  = 1 the measurement time is halved to approximately 1.5 ms. 
When using the 18 kΩ pullup resistor with the thermistor, the time constant will generally be less than (18 kΩ) 
× C, so a capacitor less than 4 nF is recommended. When using the 180-kΩ pullup resistor, the capacitor 
should be less than 400 pF.
•The integrated charge pump generates a voltage on the CP1 capacitor, requiring approximately 60 ms to 
charge up to approximately 11 V when first enabled, when using the recommended 470 nF capacitor value. 
When the CHG or DSG drivers are enabled, charge redistribution occurs from the CP1 capacitor to the CHG 
and DSG capacitive FET loads. This will generally result in a brief drop in the voltage on CP1, which is then 
replenished by the charge pump. If the FET capacitive loading is large, such that at FET turn-on the voltage 
on CP1 drops below an acceptable level for the application, then the value of the CP1 capacitor can be 
increased. This has the drawback of requiring a longer startup time for the voltage on CP1 when the charge 
pump is first powered on, and so should be evaluated to ensure it is acceptable in the system. For example, 
if the CHG and DSG FETs are enabled simultaneously and their combined gate capacitance is approximately 
400 nF, then changing CP1 to a value of 2200 nF will result in the 11-V charge pump level dropping to 
approximately 9 V, before being restored to the 11-V level by the charge pump.www.ti.comBQ76952

–This value depends on the cell chemistry and the load requirements of the system. For example, to 
support a minimum battery voltage of 40 V using Li-CO2 type cells with a cell minimum voltage of 3 V, 
there needs to be at least 14-series cells.
–For the correct cell connections, see Section 10.1.2 .
•Protection FET selection and configuration
–The BQ76952 device is designed for use with high-side NFET protection (low-side protection NFETs can 
be used by leveraging the DCHG / DDSG signals)
–The configuration should be selected for series versus parallel FETs, which may lead to different FET 
selection for charge versus discharge direction.
–These FETs should be rated for the maximum:
•Voltage, which should be approximately 5 V (DC) to 10 V (peak) per series cell.
•Current, which should be calculated based on both the maximum DC current and the maximum 
transient current with some margin.
•Power Dissipation, which can be a factor of the RDS(ON) rating of the FET, the FET package, and the 
PCB design.
–The overdrive level of the BQ76952 device charge pump should be selected based on RDS(ON) 
requirements for the protection FETs and their voltage handling requirements. If the FETs are selected 
with a maximum gate-to-source voltage of 15 V, then the 11 V overdrive mode within the BQ76952 device 
can be used. If the FETs are not specified to withstand this level, or there is a concern over gate leakage 
current on the FETs, the lower overdrive level of 5.5 V can be selected.
•Sense resistor selection
–The resistance value should be selected to maximize the input range of the coulomb counter but not 
exceed the absolute maximum ratings, and avoid excessive heat generation within the resistor.
•Using the normal maximum charge or discharge current, the sense resistor = 200 mV / 20.0 A = 10 mΩ 
maximum.
•However, considering a short circuit discharge current of 80 A, the recommended maximum SRP, SRN 
voltage of ≈0.75 V, and the maximum SCD threshold of 500 mV, the sense resistor should be below 
500 mV / 80 A= 6.25 mΩ maximum.
–Further tolerance analysis (value tolerance, temperature variation, and so on) and PCB design margin 
should also be considered, so a sense resistor of 1 mΩ is suitable with a 50-ppm temperature coefficient 
and power rating of 1 W.
•The REG1 is selected to provide the supply for an external host processor, with output voltage selected for 
3.3 V.
–The NPN BJT used for the REG0 preregulator should be selected to support the maximum collector-to-
emitter voltage of the maximum charging voltage of 68 V. The gain of the BJT should be chosen so it 
can provide the required maximum output current with a base current level that can be provided from the 
BQ76952 device.
–The BJT should support the maximum current expected from the REG1 (maximum of 45 mA, with short 
circuit current limit of up to ≈80 mA).
–A diode can optionally be included in the collector circuit of the BJT, in order to avoid reverse current flow 
from BREG through the base-collector junction of the BJT to PACK+ during a pack short circuit event. This 
diode can be seen in Figure 16-2  at D2.
–A large resistor (such as 10 MΩ) is recommended from BREG to VSS, to avoid any unintended leakage 
current that may occur during SHUTDOWN mode.

16.2.4 Calibration Process
The BQ76952 device enables customers to calibrate the current, voltage, and temperature measurements on 
the customer production line. Detailed procedures are included in the BQ76952 Technical Reference Manual . 
The device provides the capability to calibrate individual cell voltage measurements, stack voltage, PACK pin 
voltage, LD pin voltage, current measurement, and individual temperature measurements.
16.3 Random Cell Connection Support
The BQ76952 device supports a random connection sequence of cells to the device during pack manufacturing. 
For example, cell-10 in a 16-cell stack might be first connected at the input terminals leading to pins VC10 and 
VC9, then cell-4 may next be connected at the input terminals leading to pins VC4 and VC3, and so on. It is 
not necessary to connect the negative terminal of cell-1 first at VC0. As another example, consider a cell stack 
that is already assembled and cells already interconnected to each other, then the stack is connected to the 
PCB through a connector, which is plugged or soldered to the PCB. In this case, the sequence order in which 
the connections are made to the PCB can be random in time, they do not need to be controlled in a certain 
sequence.
There are, however, some restrictions to how the cells are connected during manufacturing:
•To avoid misunderstanding, note that the cells in a stack cannot  be randomly connected to any VC pin on 
the device, such as the lowest cell (cell-1) connected to VC15, while the top cell (cell-16) is connected to 
VC4, and so on. It is important that the cells in the stack be connected in ascending pin order, with the lowest 
cell (cell-1) connected between VC1 and VC0, the next higher voltage cell (cell-2) connected between VC2 
and VC1, and so on.
•The random cell connection support is possible due to high voltage tolerance on pins VC1–VC16. 
Note
VC0 has a lower voltage tolerance. This is because VC0 should be connected through the series-
cell input resistor to the VSS pin on the PCB, before any cells are attached to the PCB. Thus, the 
VC0 pin voltage is expected to remain close to the VSS pin voltage during cell attach. If VC0 is 
not connected through the series resistor to VSS on the PCB, then cells cannot be connected in 
random sequence.
•Each of the VC1–VC16 pins includes a diode between the pin and the adjacent lower cell input pin (that is, 
between VC16 and VC15, between VC9 and VC8, and so on), which is reverse biased in normal operation. 
This means an upper cell input pin should not be driven to a low voltage while a lower cell input pin is driven 
to a higher voltage, since this would forward bias these diodes. During cell attach, the cell input terminals BQ76952

================================================================================

should generally be floating before they are connected to the appropriate cell. It is expected that transient 
current will flow briefly when each cell is attached, but the cell voltages will quickly stabilize to a state without 
DC current flowing through the diodes. However, if a large capacitance is included between a cell input pin 
and another terminal (such as VSS or another cell input pin), the transient current may become excessive 
and lead to device heating. Therefore, it is recommended to limit capacitances applied at each cell input pin 
to the values recommended in the specifications.
16.4 Startup Timing
At initial power up of the BQ76952 device from a SHUTDOWN state, the device progresses through a sequence 
of events before entering NORMAL mode operation. These are described below for an example configuration, 
with approximate timing shown for the cases when [FASTADC]  = 0 and [FASTADC]  = 1.
Note
When the device is configured for autonomous FET control (that is, [FET_EN]  = 1), the decision to 
enable FETs is only evaluated every 250 ms while in NORMAL mode, which is why the FETs are 
not enabled until approximately 280 ms after the wakeup event, even though the data was available 
earlier.

16.5 FET Driver Turn-Off
The high-side CHG and DSG FET drivers operate differently when they are triggered to turn off their respective 
FET. The CHG driver includes an internal switch which discharges the CHG pin toward the BAT pin level. The 
DSG FET driver will discharge the DSG pin toward the LD pin level, but it includes a more complex structure 
than just a switch, to support a faster turn off.
When the DSG driver is triggered to turn off, the device will initially begin discharging the DSG pin toward VSS. 
However, since the PACK+ terminal may not fall to a voltage near VSS quickly, the DSG FET gate should 
not be driven significantly below PACK+, otherwise the DSG FET may be damaged due to excessive negative 
gate-source voltage. Thus, the device monitors the voltage on the LD pin (which is connected to PACK+ through 
an external series resistor) and will stop the discharge when the DSG pin voltage drops below the LD pin 
voltage. When the discharge has stopped, the DSG pin voltage may relax back above the LD pin voltage, at 
which point the device will again discharge the DSG pin toward VSS, until the DSG gate voltage again falls 
below the LD pin voltage. This repeats in a series of pulses which over time discharge the DSG gate to the 
voltage of the LD pin. This pulsing continues for approximately 100 to 200 μs, after which the driver remains in a 
high impedance state if within approximately 500 mV of the voltage of the LD pin. The external resistor between 
the DSG gate and source then discharges the remaining FET V GS voltage so the FET remains off.
The external series gate resistor between the DSG pin and the DSG FET gate is used to adjust the speed of the 
turn-off transient. A low resistance (such as 100 Ω) will provide a fast turn-off during a short circuit event, but this 
may result in an overly large inductive spike at the top of stack when the FET is disabled. A larger resistor value 
(such as 1 kΩ or 4.7 kΩ) will reduce this speed and the corresponding inductive spike level.
Oscilloscope captures of DSG driver turn-off are shown below, with the DSG pin driving the gate of a 
CSD19536KCS NFET, which has a typical C iss of 9250 pF. Figure 16-6  shows the signals when using a 1-k Ω 
series gate resistor between the DSG pin and the FET gate, and a light load on PACK+, such that the voltage on 
PACK+ drops slowly as the FET is disabled. The pulsing on the DSG pin can be seen lasting for approximately 
170 μs.BQ76952

Table 16-3. Terminating Unused Pins
Pin Name Recommendation
1–16, 48 VC0–VC16Cell inputs 1, 2, and 16 should always be connected to actual cells, with cells connected between VC1 and 
VC0, VC2 and VC1, and VC16 and VC15. VC0 should be connected through a resistor and capacitor on the 
pcb to pin 17 (VSS). Pins related to unused cells (which may be cell 3–cell 15, pins 1–13) can be connected to 
the cell stack to measure interconnect resistance or provide a Kelvin-connection to actual cells, in which case 
they should include a series resistor and parallel capacitor, in similar fashion to pins connected to actual cells 
(see Usage of VC Pins for Cells Versus Interconnect ). Another option is to short unused VC pins directly to an 
adjacent VC pin. All VC pins should be connected to either an adjacent VC pin, an actual cell (through R and C) 
or stack interconnect resistance (through R and C).
18, 20 SRP, SRN If not used, these pins should be connected to pin 17 (VSS).
19, 44 NCThese pins are not connected to silicon. They can be left floating or connected to an adjacent pin or connected 
to VSS.
21, 23, 
25, 28, 
29, 30, 
31, 32TS1, TS3, 
ALERT, HDQ, 
CFETOFF, 
DFETOFF, 
DCHG, DDSGIf not used, these pins can be left floating or connected to pin 17 (VSS). Any of these pins (except for TS1 and 
TS3) may be configured with the internal weak pulldown resistance enabled during operation, although this is 
not necessary.
22 TS2If the device is intended to enter SHUTDOWN mode, the TS2 pin should be left floating. If SHUTDOWN mode 
will not be used in the application, and the TS2 pin will not be used for a thermistor or ADCIN measurement, the 
TS2 pin can be left floating or connected to pin 17 (VSS).
33 RST_SHUT If not used, this pin should be connected to pin 17 (VSS).
34, 35 REG1, REG2 If not used, these pins can be left floating or connected to pin 17 (VSS).
36 REGIN If not used, this pin should be connected to pin 17 (VSS).
37 BREGIf this pin is not used and pin 36 (REGIN) is also not used, both pins should be connected to pin 17 (VSS). If this 
pin is not used but pin 36 is used (such as driven from an external source), then this pin should be connected to 
pin 36 (REGIN).
38 FUSE If not used, this pin can be left floating or connected to pin 17 (VSS).
39 PDSG If not used, this pin should be left floating.
40 PCHG If not used, this pin should be left floating.
41 LDIf the DSG driver will not be used, this pin can be connected through a series resistor to the PACK+ connector, 
or can be connected to pin 17 (VSS).
43 DSG If not used, this pin should be left floating.
45 CHG If not used, this pin should be left floating.
46 CP1If not used, this pin should be connected to pin 47 (BAT).
Note
If the charge pump is enabled with CP1 connected to BAT, the device will consume an additional 
≈200 µA.
17 Power Supply Requirements
The BQ76952 device draws its supply current from the BAT pin, which is typically connected to the top of stack 
point through a series diode, to protect against any fault within the device resulting in unintended charging of the 
pack. A series resistor and capacitor is included to lowpass filter fast variations on the stack voltage. During a 
short circuit event, the stack voltage may be momentarily pulled to a very low voltage before the protection FETs 
are disabled. In this case, the charge on the BAT pin capacitor will temporarily support the BQ76952 device's 
supply current, to avoid the device losing power.
18 Layout
18.1 Layout Guidelines
•The quality of the Kelvin connections at the sense resistor is critical. The sense resistor must have 
a temperature coefficient no greater than 50 ppm in order to minimize current measurement drift with 
temperature. Choose the value of the sense resistor to correspond to the available overcurrent and short-www.ti.comBQ76952

circuit ranges of the BQ76952 device. Parallel resistors can be used as long as good Kelvin sensing is 
ensured. The device is designed to support a 1-mΩ sense resistor.
•In reference to the system circuitry, the following features require attention for component placement and 
layout: Differential Low-Pass Filter, and I2C communication.
•The BQ76952 device uses an integrating delta-sigma ADC for current measurements. For best performance, 
100-Ω resistors should be included from the sense resistor terminals to the SRP and SRN inputs of the 
device, with a 0.1-μF filter capacitor placed across the SRP and SRN pins. Optional 0.1-µF filter capacitors 
can be added for additional noise filtering at each sense input pin to ground. All filter components should 
be placed as close as possible to the device, rather than close to the sense resistor, and the traces from 
the sense resistor routed in parallel to the filter circuit. A ground plane can also be included around the filter 
network to add additional noise immunity.
•The BQ76952 device internal REG18 LDO requires an external decoupling capacitor, which should be placed 
as close to the REG18 pin as possible, with minimized trace inductance, and connected to a ground plane 
electrically connected to VSS.
•The I2C clock and data pins have integrated ESD protection circuits; however, adding a Zener diode and 
series resistor on each pin provides more robust ESD performance.
18.2 Layout Example
An example circuit layout using the BQ76952 device in a 16-series cell design is described below. The design 
implements the schematic shown in Figure 16-2  and Figure 16-3 , and uses a 2.75-inch × 3.9-inch 2-layer circuit 
card assembly, with cell connections on the left edge, and pack connections along the top edge of the board. 
Wide trace areas are used, reducing voltage drops on the high current paths.
The board layout, which is shown in Figure 18-1  and Figure 18-2 , includes spark gaps with the reference 
designator prefix E. These spark gaps are fabricated with the board and no component is installed.BQ76952
