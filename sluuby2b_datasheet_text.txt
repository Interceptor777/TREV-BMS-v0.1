2.1 Overview
The BQ76952 product is a highly integrated, accurate battery monitor and protector for 3-series to 16-series 
li-ion, li-polymer, and LiFePO 4 battery packs. A high accuracy voltage, current, and temperature measurement 
accuracy provides data for host-based algorithms and control. A feature-rich and highly configurable protection 
subsystem provides a wide set of protections which can be triggered and recovered completely autonomously 
by the device or under full control of a host processor. The integrated charge pump with high-side protection 
NFET drivers allows host communication with the device even when FETs are off by preserving the ground 
connection to the pack. Dual programmable LDOs are included for external system use, with each independently 
programmable to voltages of 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.0 V, 3.3 V, and 5.0 V, capable of providing up to 45 mA each.
The BQ76952 device includes one-time-programmable (OTP) memory for customers to setup device operation 
on their own production line. Multiple communications interfaces are supported, including 400-kHz I2C, SPI, 
and HDQ one-wire standards. Multiple digital control and status data are available through several multifunction 
pins on the device, including an interrupt to the host processor, and independent controls for host override of 
each high-side protection NFET. Three dedicated pins are provided for temperature measurement using external 
thermistors, and multifunction pins can be programmed to use for additional thermistors, supporting a total of up 
to 9 thermistors, in addition to an internal die temperature measurement. Figure 2-1  shows the BQ76952 block 
diagram.Chapter 2

3.1 Direct Commands and Subcommands
The BQ76952 device includes support for direct commands and subcommands. The direct commands are 
accessed using a 7-bit command address that is sent from a host through the device serial communications 
interface and either triggers an action, or provides a data value to be written to the device, or instructs the device 
to report data back to the host. Subcommands are additional commands that are accessed indirectly using 
the 7-bit command address space and provide the capability for block data transfers. When a subcommand 
is initiated, a 16-bit subcommand address is first written to the 7-bit command addresses 0x3E (lower byte) 
and 0x3F (upper byte). The device initially assumes a read-back of data may be needed, and auto-populates 
existing data into the 32-byte transfer buffer (which uses 7-bit command addresses 0x40–0x5F), and writes the 
checksum for this data into address 0x60. If the host instead intends to write data into the device, the host will 
overwrite the new data into the transfer buffer, a checksum for the data into address 0x60, and the data length 
into address 0x61. As soon as address 0x61 is written, the device checks the checksum written into 0x60 with 
the data written into 0x40-0x5F, and if this is correct, it proceeds to transfer the data from the transfer buffer 
into the device's memory. The checksum is the 8-bit sum of the subcommand bytes (0x3E and 0x3F) plus the 
number of bytes used in the transfer buffer, then the result is bitwise inverted. The verification cannot take place 
until the data length is written, so the device realizes how many bytes in the transfer buffer are included. The 
checksum and data length must be written together as a word in order to be valid. The data length includes the 
two bytes in 0x3E and 0x3F, the two bytes in 0x60 and 0x61, and the length of the transfer buffer. Therefore, if 
the entire 32-byte transfer buffer is used, the data length will be 0x24.
Some subcommands are only used to initiate an action and do not involve sending or receiving data. In these 
cases, the host can simply write the subcommand into 0x3E and 0x3F, it is not necessary to write the length and 
checksum or any further data.
The commands supported in the device are described in Commands and Subcommands . Single-byte 
commands are direct commands, while two-byte commands are subcommands. Data formats are described 
in Data Formats .
The most efficient approach to read the data from a subcommand (to minimize bus traffic) is shown below:
1.Write lower byte of subcommand to 0x3E.
2.Write upper byte of subcommand to 0x3F.
3.Read 0x3E and 0x3F. If this returns 0xFF, this indicates the subcommand has not completed operation 
yet. When the subcommand has completed, the readback will return what was originally written. Continue 
reading 0x3E and 0x3F until it returns what was written originally. Note: this response only applies to 
subcommands that return data to be read back.
4.Read the length of response from 0x61.
5.Read buffer starting at 0x40 for the expected length.
6.Read the checksum at 0x60 and verify it matches the data read.
An easier approach that is less efficient on bus traffic is:
1.Write the lower byte of the subcommand to 0x3E.
2.Write the upper byte of the subcommand to 0x3F.
3.Read 0x3E and 0x3F. If this returns 0xFF, this indicates that the subcommand has not completed the 
operation yet. When the subcommand has completed, the readback will return what was originally written. Chapter 3

Continue reading 0x3E and 0x3F until it returns what was written originally. Note: this response only applies 
to subcommands that return data to be read back.
4.Read 0x40 to 0x61 in a block. Ensure that the checksum at 0x60 is correct over the length designated by 
0x61. This means sometimes more bytes are read than necessary, but it also makes it possible to use a 
standard function that can be called for all subcommands.
Note: 0x61 provides the length of the buffer data plus 4 (that is, length of the buffer data plus the length of 0x3E 
and 0x3F plus the length of 0x60 and 0x61).
The checksum is calculated over 0x3E, 0x3F, and the buffer data, it does not include the checksum or length in 
0x60 and 0x61.
If the checksum and length are read together, this can trigger an auto increment in some cases, in which case 
the buffer will be populated with another block's data. So, generally the checksum and length should not be read 
together unless the buffer has already been read, or if auto-incrementing is intended.
Command or subcommand bits denoted RSVD_0 should only be written as a "0", while bits denoted RSVD_1 
should only be written as a "1".
3.2 Configuration Using OTP or Registers
The BQ76952 device includes registers, which are stored in the RAM, and are integrated in one-time 
programmable (OTP) memory. At initial power-up, the device loads OTP settings into registers, which are 
used by the device firmware during operation. The device can also perform a reset on demand if the 0x0012 
RESET()  subcommand is sent. The recommended procedure is for the customer to write settings into OTP on 
the manufacturing line, in which case the device will use these settings whenever it is powered up. Alternatively, 
the host processor can initialize registers after power-up, without using the OTP memory, but the registers will 
need to be re-initialized after each power cycle of the device. Register values are preserved while the device 
is in NORMAL, SLEEP, or DEEPSLEEP modes. If the device enters SHUTDOWN mode, all register memory is 
cleared, and the device will return to the default parameters when powered again.
The OTP memory in the BQ76952 device is initially all-zeros. Each bit can be left as a "0" or written to a 
"1," but it cannot be written from a "1" back to a "0." The OTP memory includes two full images of the Data 
Memory configuration settings. At power-up, the device will XOR each setting in the first OTP image with the 
corresponding setting in the second OTP image and with the default value for the corresponding setting, with 
the resulting value stored into the RAM register for use during operation. This allows any setting to be changed 
from the default value using the first image, then changed back to the default once using the second image. The 
OTP memory also includes a 16-bit signature, which is calculated over most of the settings and stored in OTP. 
When the device is powered up, it will read the OTP settings and check that the signature matches that stored, 
to provide robustness against bit errors in reading or corruption of the memory. If a signature error is detected, 
the device will boot into the default configuration (as if the OTP is cleared).
The device supports up to eight different signature values, so up to eight partial changes in OTP can be made, 
with the signature updated accordingly. The OTP signature does not include the Manufacturing Data (available 
using the 0x0070 MANU_DATA()  subcommand) nor any PF status data that was written to OTP (which is read 
using the 0x0053 SAVED_PF_STATUS()  subcommand).
The OTP memory settings are typically written after the device is assembled onto the PCB, but before cells 
are attached to the board. Programming the OTP memory settings requires the voltage applied on the BAT 
pin and the temperature to be within allowed limits, per specifications. All configuration settings are first 
loaded into registers using the serial communication interface (see Chapter 9). The 0x00A0 OTP_WR_CHECK() 
subcommand can be sent to initiate a self-check whether OTP writing can be accomplished. The device must be 
in FULLACCESS and CONFIG_UPDATE modes when this subcommand is sent. Table 3-1  shows the 0x00A0 
OTP_WR_CHECK()  information the device returns.Device Configuration www.ti.com

If the self-check is successful, then the actual OTP write can be initiated by sending the 0x00A1 OTP_WRITE() 
subcommand. This subcommand provides the same feedback as the 0x00A0 OTP_WR_CHECK()  subcommand 
above, with byte-0, bit-7 being set if programming completed successfully. The time for OTP programming 
depends on the number of bytes that must be programmed, with the device taking approximately 200 μs per 
byte programmed.
Special exceptions are provided that allow programming the Manufacturing Data and PF status data to OTP 
during normal operation if Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[OTPW_EN]  is set.
Note
The Manufacturing Data can be written with device settings while in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, as 
described above, but it can also be written using the MANU_DATA()  subcommand in FULLACCESS 
mode. When Manufacturing Data is written using this subcommand, or the PF status data is 
written (which requires both Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_OTP]  = 1 and 
Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[OTPW_EN]  = 1), the minimum voltage required on BAT is 
still checked and required for programming, but the maximum voltage is not restricted to the specified 
level, since this may not be practical in normal system operation. This OTP programming is performed 
at a slow rate of approximately 125 ms per byte while in normal system operation.

4.1 Voltage Measurement
The BQ76952 device integrates a voltage ADC that is multiplexed between measurements of cell voltages, an 
internal temperature sensor, up to nine external thermistors, and also performs measurements of the voltage 
at the VC16 pin, the PACK pin, the LD pin, the internal Vref used by the coulomb counter, and the VSS rail 
(for diagnostic purposes). The BQ76952 device supports measurement of individual differential cell voltages 
in a series configuration, ranging from 3-series cells to 16-series cells. Each cell voltage measurement is a 
differential measurement of the voltage between two adjacent cell input pins, such as VC1-VC0, VC2-VC1, and 
so forth. The cell voltage measurements are processed based on trim and calibration corrections, and then 
reported in 16-bit resolution using units of 1 mV. The raw 24-bit digital output of the ADC is also available for 
readout using 32-bit subcommands (the 24-bit data is contained in the lower 3 bytes of the 32-bit data, and is 
sign-extended to create the upper byte). The cell voltage measurements can support a recommended voltage 
range from –0.2 V to 5.5 V. If a cell voltage is applied that exceeds a level of 5 × VREF1 (approximately 6.06 
V), the device may report a value of –6.06 V (and the cell voltage raw counts similarly would report a value of 
–8388608). For the best performance, it is recommended to stay at a maximum input of 5.5 V. The 16-bit cell 
and VC16 (stack), PACK, and LD pin voltage measurements are available by using the commands listed below.

4.1.1 Voltage Measurement Schedule
The BQ76952 voltage measurements are taken in a measurement loop that consists of multiple measurement 
slots. All 16 cell voltages are measured on each loop, then one slot is used for one of the VC16 or PACK or Chapter 4

LD pin voltages, one slot is used for internal temperature or Vref or VSS measurement, then up to three slots 
are used to measure thermistors or multifunction pin voltages (ADCIN functionality). Over the course of three 
loops, a full set of measurements is completed. One measurement loop consists of either 18 (if no thermistors or 
ADCIN are enabled), 19 (if one thermistor or ADCIN is enabled), 20 (if two thermistors or ADCIN are enabled), 
or 21 (if three or more thermistors or ADCIN are enabled) measurement slots.
The speed of a measurement loop can be controlled by settings. Each voltage measurement (slot) takes 3 
ms (or 1.5 ms if Settings:Configuration:Power Config:FASTADC  is set), so a typical measurement loop 
with 21 slots per loop takes 63 ms (or 31.5 ms if Settings:Configuration:Power Config:FASTADC  is set). 
If measurement data is not required as quickly, the timing for the measurement loop can be programmed 
to slower speeds, which injects idle slots in each loop after the measurement slots. Using slower loop 
cycle time will reduce the power dissipation of the device when in NORMAL mode. This is set using the 
Settings:Configuration:Power Config:LOOP_SLOW_0  and LOOP_SLOW_1  configuration bits, as shown 
below. For example, assuming a typical measurement loop with 21 slots (63 ms) per loop, and these settings 
configured for half speed (126 ms), the device will inject 21 current-only slots after each measurement loop of 21 
slots.

4.1.2 Usage of VC Pins for Cells Versus Interconnect
If the BQ76952 device is used in a system with fewer than 16 series cells, the additional cell inputs can be 
utilized to improve measurement performance. For example, a long connection may exist between two cells in 
a pack, such that there may be significant interconnect resistance between the cells, such as shown in Figure 
4-1 between CELL-A and CELL-B. By connecting VC12 close to the positive terminal of CELL-B, and connecting 
VC13 close to the negative terminal of CELL-A, more accurate cell voltage measurements are obtained for 
CELL-A and CELL-B, since the I·R voltage across the interconnect resistance between the cells is not included 
in either cell voltage measurement. Since the device reports the voltage across the interconnect resistance and 
the synchronized current in DASTATUS1–4() , the resistance of the interconnect between CELL-A and CELL-B 
can also be calculated and monitored during operation. It is recommended to include the series resistance and 
bypass capacitor on cell inputs connected in this manner, as shown below.
Note: it is important that the differential input for each cell input not fall below –0.3 V (the Absolute Maximum 
datasheet limit), with the recommended minimum voltage of –0.2 V. Therefore, it is important that the I·R voltage 
drop across the interconnect resistance does not cause a violation of this requirement.Measurement Subsystem www.ti.com

The Settings:Configuration:Vcell mode  configuration register is used to specify which cell inputs are used for 
actual cells. The device uses this information to disable cell voltage protections associated with inputs which are 
used to measure interconnect or are not used at all. Voltage measurements for all inputs are reported in 16-bit 
format (in units of mV) as well as 32-bit format (in units of raw ADC counts), irrespective of whether they are 
used for cells or not.

Cell 16 Interconnect  in units of mΩ. The device will subtract the measured current times these interconnect 
resistance values from each differential cell voltage measurement before reporting the final cell voltage value.
4.2 General Purpose ADCIN Functionality
Several multifunction pins on the BQ76952 device can be used for general purpose ADC input (ADCIN) 
measurement, if not being used for other purposes. This includes the TS1, TS2, TS3, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, 
HDQ, DCHG, DDSG, and ALERT pins. When used for ADCIN functionality, the internal bandgap reference is 
used by the ADC, and the input range of the ADC is limited to the REG18 pin voltage. The digital fullscale range 
of the ADC is effectively 1.6667 × VREF1, which is approximately 2.02 V during normal operation. To configure 
the multifunction pins for this functionality, see Section 6.4.
When a pin is configured for ADCIN functionality, the voltage is reported in mV using the command that normally 
reports thermistor temperature on that pin. For example, if TS1 is configured for ADCIN functionality, the 0x70 
TS1 Temperature()  command will return a 16-bit signed value corresponding to the pin voltage in mV.
The BQ76952 device also reports the raw ADC counts in 0x0076 DASTATUS6()  when a measurement is taken 
using the TS1 pin. This data can be used during manufacturing to better calibrate the ADCIN functionality.
4.3 Coulomb Counter and Digital Filters
The BQ76952 device monitors pack current using a low-side sense resistor, which connects to the SRP and 
SRN pins through an external RC filter, which should be connected such that a charging current will create a 
positive voltage on SRP relative to SRN. The device supports sense resistors of 1 mΩ or below. The differential 
voltage between SRP and SRN is digitized by an integrated coulomb counter ADC, which can digitize voltages 
over a ±200-mV range and uses multiple digital filters to provide optimized measurement of the instantaneous, 
averaged, and integrated current. The pins can also support higher positive voltages relative to VSS, such 
as which may occur during overcurrent or short circuit in discharge conditions, without damage to the device, 
although the current is not accurately digitized in this case. Multiple digitized current values are available, 
including two using separate hardware digital filters, CC1 and CC2, as well as a firmware filter CC3.
The units for the current reporting are in userA (userAmps), which can be programmed to be 0.1 mA, 1 mA, 10 
mA, or 100 mA using the Settings:Configuration:DA Configuration:[USER_AMPS_1:0]  configuration setting. 
Given the 16-bit values can range from –32768 to +32767, this allows representation of currents ranging from
–3276 A to +3276 A.

The CC1 filter generates a 16-bit current measurement that is used for charge integration and other decision 
purposes, with one output generated every 250 ms when the device is operating in NORMAL mode. The CC1 
data is available from the 0x0075 DAStatus5()  subcommand.
The CC2 filter generates a 24-bit current measurement that is used for current reporting, with one output every 
3 ms when the device is operating in NORMAL mode (which can be reduced to one output every 1.5 ms when 
the Settings:Configuration:Power Config[FASTADC]  bit is set, with reduced measurement resolution). It is 
reported in 16-bit format using the 0x3A CC2 Current()  command. The 32-bit CC2 data is available as raw 
coulomb counter ADC counts from the 0x0075 DASTATUS5()  subcommand (the 24-bit data is contained in the 
lower three bytes of the 32-bit data, and is sign-extended to create the upper byte).
The CC3 filter output is an average of a programmable number of CC2 current samples (up to 255), which are 
set using the Settings:Configuration:CC3 Samples  configuration setting. The CC3 output is reported in 16-bit 
format using the 0x0075 DASTATUS5()  subcommand. The 32-bit CC3 data is also available in units of ADC Measurement Subsystem www.ti.com

counts from the 0x0075 DASTATUS5()  subcommand (the averaged data is contained in the lower bytes of the 
32-bit data, and is sign-extended into the upper byte).
The integrated passed charge is available as a 64-bit value from the 0x0076 DASTATUS6()  subcommand, which 
includes the upper 32-bits of accumulated charge in units of userAh, the lower 32-bits of accumulated charge 
as the fractional portion, and a 32-bit accumulated time over which the charge has been integrated in units 
of seconds. The accumulated charge integration and timer can be reset using the 0x0082 RESET_PASSQ() 
subcommand. If the device undergoes a partial reset or is reset using the RST_SHUT pin, the 0x0082 
RESET_PASSQ()  should be sent to ensure the charge accumulation is properly initialized.
4.4 Synchronized Voltage and Current Measurement
While the cell voltages are digitized sequentially using a single muxed ADC during normal operation, the current 
is digitized continuously by the dedicated coulomb counter ADC. The current is measured synchronously with 
each cell voltage measurement, and can be used for individual cell impedance analysis. The ongoing periodic 
current measurements can be read out through the digital communication interface, while the measurements 
taken that were synchronized with particular cell voltage measurements are stored paired with the associated 
cell voltage measurement for separate readout. The synchronous voltage and current data are available in units 
of raw ADC counts through the 0x0071-0x0074 subcommands. The Cell-1 voltage is measured and stored as 
Cell 1 Voltage Cnts() , the current is simultaneously measured and stored as Cell 1 Current Cnts() , and similarly 
for all other cells. Reading this data from the block subcommands ensures the synchronously aligned voltage 
and current data are read out together.
4.5 Subcommands 0x0071–0x0074 DASTATUS1-4() , Cell Voltage and Synchronized Current 
Counts
The 0x0071 DASTATUS1() , 0x0072 DASTATUS2() , 0x0073 DASTATUS3() , and 0x0074 DASTATUS4() 
subcommands provide raw ADC counts in 32-bit format of the cell voltage measurements, as well as the 
synchronized current measurements taken simultaneously with each cell voltage measurement. Note: only 24-bit 
raw data is generated by the data converters, but it is provided in a 32-bit numerical format (the 24-bit data 
is contained in the lower 3 bytes of the 32-bit data, and is sign-extended to create the upper byte). The raw 
ADC data provided for cell voltage measurements uses a digital fullscale range of ± (5 × VREF1), although cell 
voltage measurements more negative than –0.2 V cannot practically be measured. The raw coulomb counter 
ADC data provided for current measurements uses a digital fullscale range of ± (VREF2 / 5).
The 32-bit cell voltage counts data has an LSB value of approximately 5 × V REF1 / 223 ≅ 5 × 1.212 V / 223 ≅ 
0.722 μV. Note that this data has not been processed using the internal factory gain and offset trim corrections, 
which are used for calculation of the 16-bit data provided by the Cell # Voltage()  commands.
The 32-bit current counts data has an LSB value of approximately V REF2 / (5 × 223) ≅ 1.24 V / (5 × 223) ≅ 29.56 
nV.
Note
This data is not processed for gain or offset, which are used for calculating the 16-bit current data 
provided by the CC2 Current()  and CC3 Current()  commands.

4.6 Subcommands 0x0075–0x0077 DASTATUS5–7() , Additional Measurements
The 0x0075 DASTATUS5()  subcommand provides voltage measurements of the REG18 LDO voltage, the VSS 
pin, as well as calculated values for the minimum, maximum, and sum of cell-voltage measurements. It also 
provides the readings used for cell and FET temperature, minimum, maximum, and average cell temperature, 
and both CC1 and CC3 current values.
Since the VREF2 measurement is measured by the voltage ADC using VREF1, the REG18 voltage 
measurement provides information on the ratio of one reference versus the other and should stay approximately 
constant. This measurement can be used as a diagnostic check to determine if one reference changes value 
versus the other.
The VSS measurement is included as an additional diagnostic measurement to ensure that the ADC input 
mux is working properly. This measurement should normally result in a value near 0. If an internal fault were 
to occur that caused the ADC input mux to be stuck at a particular setting, such as a cell input, then the Measurement Subsystem www.ti.com

VSS measurement would be significantly higher. If the mux were stuck at a setting such as an interconnect 
measurement or VSS, the cell voltage measurements would be reported as very low voltage.
The battery voltage Ssum is the sum of all enabled cell voltage measurements, reported in units of cV (10 mV). 
This value can be compared with the 0x34 Stack Voltage()  and used as a diagnostic check.
Note
Because the measurements are taken by the same ADC at different times, transient changes in the 
cell voltages can cause differences in the sum versus the stack measurement, and will need to be 
considered.
The 32-bit raw CC2 counts and raw CC3 counts data has an LSB value of approximately V REF2 / (5 × 223) ≅ 1.24

pins has a different LSB value depending on whether the pin is configured for thermistor measurement mode or 
general purpose ADC (ADCIN) input mode. When configured for thermistor measurement, the raw ADC counts 
have an LSB of approximately 5 / 3 × 1.8 V / 223 ≅ 0.358 μV. When configured for ADCIN measurement, the raw 
ADC counts have an LSB of approximately 5 / 3 × V REF1 / 223 ≅ 5 / 3 × 1.212 V / 223 ≅ 0.241 μV. Note that this 
data has not been processed using gain and offset trim corrections, which are used for calculation of the 16-bit

4.7 Internal Temperature Measurement
The BQ76952 device integrates the capability to measure its internal die temperature by digitizing an internal 
transistor base-emitter voltage. This voltage is measured periodically as part of the measurement loop and is 
processed to provide a temperature value using the 0x68 Int Temperature()  command.
This internal temperature measurement can be used for cell temperature protections 
and logic that uses minimum, maximum, or average cell temperature by setting 
the Settings:Configuration:DA Configuration[TINT_EN]  configuration bit and keeping the 
Settings:Configuration:DA Configuration[TINT_FETT]  bit cleared. The internal temperature measurement 
can instead be used for FET temperature by setting both Settings:Configuration:DA Configuration[TINT_EN] 
and Settings:Configuration:DA Configuration[TINT_FETT] , although in this case it will not be used for cell 
temperature.
The calculation of temperature is performed as follows:
Internal Temperature (in units of 0.1 K) = (ADC value) × Calibration:Internal Temp Model:Int Gain  / 65536 + 
Calibration:Internal Temp Model:Int base offset  + Calibration:Temperature:Internal Temp Offset
except if (ADC value) > Calibration:Internal Temp Model:Int Maximum AD , then the reported internal 
temperature is calculated using the Calibration:Internal Temp Model:Int Maximum AD  as the ADC value. 
If internal temperature is calculated > Calibration:Internal Temp Model:Int Maximum Temp , the reported 
internal temperature is set to Calibration:Internal Temp Model:Int Maximum Temp .
4.8 Thermistor Temperature Measurement
The BQ76952 device includes an on-chip temperature measurement and can also support up to nine external 
thermistors on multifunction pins (TS1, TS2, TS3, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, ALERT, HDQ, DCHG, and DDSG). The 
device includes an internal pullup resistor to bias a thermistor during measurement.Measurement Subsystem www.ti.com

================================================================================

The internal pull-up resistor has two options which can set the pull-up resistor to either 18-kΩ or 180-kΩ (or 
none at all). The 18-kΩ option is intended for use with thermistors such as the Semitec 103-AT, which has 
10-kΩ resistance at room temperature. The 180-kΩ is intended for use with higher resistance thermistors such 
as the Semitec 204AP-2, which has 200-kΩ resistance at room temperature. The resistor values are measured 
during factory production and stored within the device for use during temperature calculation. The individual pin 
configuration registers determine which pin is used for a thermistor measurement, what value of pull-up resistor 
is used, as well as whether the thermistor measurement is used for a cell or FET temperature reading. For more 
detail on these pin configuration registers, see Section 6.4.

measuring FET temperature. The default parameters for the models match the Semitec 103-AT and 204AP-2 
thermistors.
In order to provide a high precision temperature result, the device uses the same 1.8 V LDO voltage for the ADC 
reference as is used for biasing the thermistor pullup resistor, thereby implementing a ratiometric measurement 
that removes the error contribution from the LDO voltage level. The device processes the digitized thermistor 
voltage to calculate the temperature based on multiorder polynomials, which can be programmed by the user 
based on the specific thermistor selected.
4.9 Factory Trim of Voltage ADC
The BQ76952 device includes factory trim for the cell voltage ADC measurements in order to optimize the 
voltage measurement performance even if no further calibration is performed by the customer. Calibration can 
be performed by the customer on the production line to further optimize the performance in the system. The 
trim information is used to correct the raw ADC readings before they are reported as 16-bit voltage values. The 
32-bit ADC voltage data, which is generated in units of ADC counts, is modified before reporting by subtracting 
a stored offset trim value. The resulting reported data does not include any further correction (such as for gain), 
therefore the customer will need to process them before use.
The device also includes a factory gain trim for the voltage measurements performed using the general purpose 
ADC input capability on the multifunction pins as well as the TS1, TS2, and TS3 pins. The raw ADC reading is 
provided for each pin in 32-bit ADC counts using the 0x0076 - 0x0077 DASTATUS6-7()  subcommands.
4.10 Voltage Calibration (ADC Measurements)
The BQ76952 device includes optional capability for the customer to calibrate each cell voltage gain and 
the gain for the stack voltage, the PACK pin voltage, and the LD pin voltage individually, and multifunction 
pin general ADC measurements. An offset calibration value Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell Offset  is included 
for use with the cell voltage measurements, and Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset  is used with the TOS 
(stack), PACK, and LD voltage measurements. The cell voltage gains determined during calibration are written 
in Calibration:Voltage:Cell 1 Gain – Cell 16 Gain , where Cell 1 Gain  is used for the measurement of VC1-
VC0, Cell 2 Gain  is used for the measurement of VC2-VC1, and so forth. Similarly, the calibration voltage 
gain for the TOS voltage should be written in Calibration:Voltage:TOS Gain , the PACK pin voltage gain in 
Calibration:Voltage:Pack Gain , the LD pin voltage gain in Calibration:Voltage:LD Gain , and multifunction pin 
general purpose ADCIN measurement gain in Calibration:Voltage:ADC Gain .
If values for the calibration gain configuration are not written, the BQ76952 device will use factory trim or default 
values for the respective gain values. When a calibration gain configuration value is written, the device will use 
that in place of any factory trim or default gain. The raw ADC measurement data (in units of counts) is corrected 
by first subtracting a stored offset trim value, then the gain is applied, then the Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell 
Offset  (for cell voltage measurements) or the Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset  (for TOS, PACK, or LD 
voltage measurements) is subtracted, before the final voltage value is reported.
The factory trim values for the Cell Gain parameters can be read from the Cell Gain data memory registers 
while in FULLACCESS mode but not in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, if the data memory values have not been 
overwritten. While in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, the Cell Gain values will read back either with all zeros, 
if they have not been overwritten, or whatever values have been written to these registers. Upon exiting 
CONFIG_UPDATE mode, readback of the Cell Gain parameters will provide the values presently used in 
operation.
The cell voltage calibration can be implemented by applying two precise DC voltages to the cell input (such 
as 2.5 V and 4.5 V) and averaging multiple raw ADC measurements in 32-bit counts obtained from the 0x0071–
0x0074 DASTATUS1–4()  subcommands for each voltage. The gain can then be calculated as:

The calibration for the TOS, PACK pin, and LD pin gain measurements can be implemented by similarly applying 
two precise DC voltages to the input and averaging multiple raw ADC measurements, which are provided in 
16-bit counts from the 0xF081 READ_CAL1()  subcommand. Note: one of the voltages can be skipped to reduce 
calibration time. The gain can then be calculated as:

The ADCIN measurement can be calibrated in similar fashion to the cell voltage gain calibration. One or two 
precise DC voltages can be applied to the selected pin, and the 32-bit counts obtained from the 0x0076 
DASTATUS6()  or 0x0077 DASTATUS7()  subcommands for each voltage. The gain can then be calculated as:

The effective fullscale digital range of the cell measurement is 5 × VREF1, and the effective fullscale digital 
range of the ADCIN measurement is 1.667 × VREF1, although the voltages applied for these measurement 
should be limited based on the device electrical specifications. Using a value for VREF1 of 1.212 V, the nominal 
gain for the cell measurements is 12120, while the nominal gain for the ADCIN measurements is 4040. The 
reported voltages are calculated as:
Cell # Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:Cell # Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536– Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell Offset
Stack Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:TOS Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536– Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset
PACK Pin Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:Pack Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536– Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset
LD Pin Voltage()  = Calibration:Voltage:LD Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536– Calibration:Vdiv Offset:Vdiv Offset
ADCIN Voltage = Calibration:Voltage:ADC Gain  × (16-bit ADC counts) / 65536
Note
Cell # Voltage()  and Calibration:Vcell Offset:Vcell Offset  both have units of mV. The divider 
voltages ( Stack Voltage() , PACK Pin Voltage() , and LD Pin Voltage() ) and Calibration:Vdiv 
Offset:Vdiv Offset  all have units of userV.
4.11 Voltage Calibration (COV and CUV Protections)
The BQ76952 device includes optional capability for the customer to calibrate the COV (cell overvoltage) and 
CUV (cell undervoltage) protection thresholds on the production line, in order to improve threshold accuracy in 
system or to realize a threshold between the preset thresholds available from the device.
This calibration is performed while the device is in CONFIG_UPDATE mode. To calibrate the COV threshold, 
an external voltage is first applied between VC16 and VC15 that is equal to the desired COV threshold. 
Next, the CAL_COV()  subcommand is sent by the host, which causes the BQ76952 device to perform a 
search for the appropriate calibration coefficients to realize a COV threshold at or close to the applied voltage 
level. When this search is completed, the resulting calibration coefficient is returned by the subcommand 
and automatically written into the Protections:COV:COV Threshold Override  configuration parameter. If this 
parameter is nonzero, the device will not use its factory trim settings but will instead use this value.www.ti.com Measurement Subsystem

The CUV threshold is calibrated similarly, an external voltage is applied between VC16 and VC15 equal to the 
desired CUV threshold. Next, while in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, the CAL_CUV()  subcommand is sent by the 
host, which causes the BQ76952 device to perform a search for the appropriate calibration coefficients to realize 
a CUV threshold at or close to the applied voltage level. When this search is completed, the resulting calibration 
coefficient is returned by the subcommand and automatically written into the Protections:CUV:CUV Threshold 
Override  configuration parameter.
4.12 Current Calibration
The BQ76952 device coulomb counter ADC measures the differential voltage between the SRP and SRN pins 
to calculate the system current. The device includes the optional capability for the customer to calibrate the 
coulomb counter offset and current gain on the production line.
The Calibration:Current Offset:Board Offset  configuration register contains an offset value in units of 32-bit 
coulomb counter ADC counts / Calibration:Current Offset:Coulomb Counter Offset Samples . The value of 
Calibration:Current Offset:Board Offset  / Calibration:Current Offset:Coulomb Counter Offset Samples  is 
subtracted from the raw coulomb counter ADC counts, then the result is multiplied by Calibration:Current:CC 
Gain  and scaled to provide the final result in units of userA.
The BQ76952 device uses the Calibration:Current:CC Gain  and Calibration:Current:Capacity Gain 
configuration values to convert from the ADC value to current. The CC Gain  reflects the value of the sense 
resistor used in the system, while the Capacity Gain  is simply the CC Gain  multiplied by 298261.6178.
Both the CC Gain  and Capacity Gain  are encoded using a 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point format. The effective 
value of the sense resistor is given by:
CC Gain  = 106× VREF2 / (5 × 32768 × Rsense in mΩ)
The nominal value of CC Gain  using the typical value of VREF2 = 1.24 V is given by:
CC Gain  = 7.5684 / (Rsense in mΩ)
To optimize the current measurement reported by the device, the value of CC Gain  can be modified on the 
customer production line to match the actual value of VREF2 in a particular device.
4.13 Temperature Calibration
The BQ76952 device enables the customer to calibrate the internal as well as external temperature 
measurements on the production line, by storing an offset value which is added to the calculated measurement 
before reporting. A separate offset for each temperature measurement can be stored in the configuration 
registers shown below.

5.1 Protections Overview
An extensive protection subsystem is integrated within BQ76952, which can monitor a variety of parameters, 
initiate protective actions, and autonomously recover based on conditions. The device also includes a wide 
range of flexibility, such that the device can be configured to monitor and initiate protective action, but 
with recovery controlled by the host processor, or such that the device only monitors and alerts the host 
processor whenever conditions warrant protective action, but with action and recovery fully controlled by the host 
processor.
The primary protection subsystem includes a suite of individual protections that can be individually enabled and 
configured, including cell undervoltage and overvoltage, overcurrent in charge, three separate overcurrent in 
discharge protections, short circuit current in discharge, cell overtemperature and undertemperature in charge 
and discharge, FET overtemperature, a host processor communication watchdog timeout, and PRECHARGE 
mode timeout. The cell undervoltage and overvoltage, overcurrent in charge, overcurrent in discharge 1 and 2, 
and short circuit in discharge protections are based on comparator thresholds, while the remaining protections 
(such as those involving temperature, host watchdog, and precharging) are based on firmware on the internal 
controller.
The device integrates NFET drivers for high-side CHG and DSG protection FETs, which can be configured 
in a series or parallel configuration. An integrated charge pump generates a voltage that is driven onto the 
NFET gates based on host command or the on-chip protection subsystem settings. Support is also included for 
high-side PFETs used to implement a precharge and predischarge functionality.
The secondary protection suite within the BQ76952 device can react to more serious faults and take 
action to permanently disable the pack, by initiating a Permanent Fail (PF). The secondary safety provides 
protection against safety cell undervoltage and overvoltage, safety overcurrent in charge and discharge, safety 
overtemperature for cells and FETs, excessive cell voltage imbalance, internal memory faults, and internal 
diagnostic failures.
When a Permanent Fail has occurred, the BQ76952 device can be configured to either simply provide a flag, or 
to indefinitely disable the protection FETs, or to assert the FUSE pin to permanently disable the pack. The FUSE 
pin can be used to blow an in-line fuse and also can monitor if a separate secondary protector IC has attempted 
to blow the fuse.
5.2 Primary Protections
5.2.1 Primary Protections Overview
The BQ76952 device integrates a broad suite of protections for battery management and provides the capability 
to enable individual protections, as well as to select which protections will result in autonomous control of the 
FETs. The Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[FET_EN]  configuration bit determines whether the device 
is in autonomous control mode (when set) or in FET test mode (when cleared). The FET test mode is primarily 
for use on a customer production line, to test individual FETs. The autonomous control mode is recommended 
for field operation, which still allows the host to disable FETs through serial communications or using the 
CFETOFF and DFETOFF pins, and block their re-enabling by the device until the host allows.
The individual protections can be enabled by setting the related Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections 
A – C  configuration registers. The protections controlled by Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A  are 
comparator-based, while those in Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B and C  are firmware-based.Chapter 5

Each protection that has been enabled can also be controlled regarding whether it will disable a particular 
FET or not by setting related configuration bits. The bits in Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections A – C 
determine which protections will trigger the CHG FET being disabled, while those in Settings:Protection:DSG 
FET Protections A – C  determine which will trigger the DSG FET being disabled. Note that protections which 
are configured to disable the CHG FET will also disable the precharge FET when it is enabled. Similarly, 
protections configured to disable the DSG FET will also disable the predischarge FET when it is enabled.
Most protections involve the device checking for a violation of a particular condition, such as a voltage or current 
threshold. As soon as a violating condition is detected for an enabled protection, a safety alert is set. Flags 
showing which safety alerts may be present are available through the 0x02 Safety Alert A , 0x04 Safety Alert B , 
and 0x06 Safety Alert C  commands, and their presence can generate an interrupt to a host processor on the 
ALERT pin.
Most protections also include a delay, such that if the violating condition persists for some time interval, a safety 
fault is triggered. Flags showing which safety faults may be present are available through the 0x03 Safety Status 
A, 0x05 Safety Status B , and 0x07 Safety Status C  commands, and their presence can generate an interrupt to a 
host processor on the ALERT pin.

5.2.2 High-Side NFET Drivers
The BQ76952 device includes an integrated charge pump and high-side NFET drivers for driving CHG and DSG 
protection FETs. The charge pump uses an external capacitor connected between the BAT and CP1 pins that 
is charged to an overdrive voltage when the charge pump is enabled (controlled using the Settings:FET:Chg 
Pump Control[CPEN]  configuration bit). Due to the time required for the charge pump to bring the overdrive 
voltage on the external CP1 pin to full voltage, it is recommended to leave the charge pump powered whenever 
it may be needed quickly to drive the CHG or DSG FETs.
The DSG FET driver includes a special option (denoted source follower mode) to drive the DSG FET with the 
BAT pin voltage during SLEEP mode. This capability is included to provide low power in SLEEP mode, when 
there is no significant charge or discharge current flowing. It is recommended to keep the charge pump enabled 
even when the source follower mode is enabled, so whenever a discharge current is detected, the device can 
quickly transition to driving the DSG FET using the charge pump voltage. The source follower mode is enabled 
by setting the Settings:FET:Chg Pump Control[SFMODE_SLEEP]  configuration bit. The source follower mode 
is not intended to be used when significant charging or discharging current is flowing, since the FET will exhibit a 
large drain-source voltage and may undergo excessive heating.www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

The overdrive level of the charge pump voltage can be set to 5.5 V or 11 V, using the Settings:FET:Chg Pump 
Control[LVEN]  configuration bit. In general, the 5.5 V setting results in lower power dissipation when a FET is 
being driven, while the higher 11 V overdrive reduces the on-resistance of the FET. If a FET exhibits significant 
gate leakage current when driven at the higher overdrive level, this can result in a higher device current for the 
charge pump to support this. In this case, using the lower overdrive level can reduce the leakage current and 
thus the device current.
The BQ76952 device supports a system with FETs in a series or parallel configuration, where the parallel 
configuration includes a separate path for the charger connection versus the discharge (load) connection. 
The control logic for the device operates slightly differently in these two cases, which is set based on the 
Settings:FET:FET Options[SFET]  configuration bit. See Section 5.2.3.1  for more information on this operation.
The FET drivers in the BQ76952 device can be controlled in several different manner, depending on customer 
requirements:
Fully autonomous
The BQ76952 device can detect protection faults and autonomously disable the FETs, monitor for a recovery 
condition, and autonomously reenable the FETs, without requiring any host processor involvement.
This mode is enabled by setting the Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[FET_EN]  configuration bit. The 
FETs may be disabled when a fault occurs based on settings in Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections 
A/B/C  and Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections A/B/C.
Partially autonomous
The BQ76952 device can detect protection faults and autonomously disable the FETs. When the host 
receives an interrupt and recognizes the fault, the host can write the 0x0093 DSG_PDSG_OFF()  or 0x0094 
CHG_PCHG_OFF()  or 0x0095 ALL_FETS_OFF()  commands to keep the FETs off until the host decides to 
release them. The 0x0097 FET_CONTROL()  subcommand can also be used to enable or disable each FET 
individually.
Alternatively, the host can assert the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins to keep the FETs off. When the host 
decides to allow the FETs to turn on again, it writes the 0x0096 ALL_FETS_ON()  command, and the BQ76952 
device will reenable the FETs if nothing is blocking them being reenabled (such as fault conditions still 
present, or the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins are asserted).
Manual control
The BQ76952 device can detect protection faults and provide an interrupt to a host processor over the 
ALERT pin. The host processor can read the status information of the fault over the communication bus 
(if desired) and can quickly force the CHG or DSG FETs off by driving the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins 
from the host processor, or using the 0x0093 DSG_PDSG_OFF()  or 0x0094 CHG_PCHG_OFF() , 0x0095 
ALL_FETS_OFF() , or 0x0097 FET_CONTROL()  subcommands.
When the host decides to allow the FETs to turn on again, it writes the 0x0096 ALL_FETS_ON()  command 
or deasserts the CFETOFF and DFETOFF pins, and the BQ76952 device will reenable the FETs if nothing is 
blocking them being reenabled.
The status of the FET drivers is provided by the [DSG_FET]  and [CHG_FET]  bits in the 0x7F FET Status() 
command. Depending on the device mode and fault status, there may be cases when only one FET is enabled, 
and the other FET is disabled. For example:
During SLEEP mode, the CHG FET may be disabled (if Settings:FET:FET Options[SLEEPCHG]  is cleared), 
while the DSG FET is enabled.
If a COV fault has occurred, the CHG FET may be disabled, while the DSG FET may still be enabled, to allow 
discharge.
If a CUV fault has occurred, the DSG FET may be disabled, while the CHG FET may still be enabled, to allow 
charging.Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems www.ti.com

If the device is in series FET configuration and a single FET is on, it is possible for current to flow through 
the off-FET body diode. This current can damage the FET if high enough for a long enough time. In this case, 
when the BQ76952 device is autonomously controlling the FETs, if a current is detected above a level given 
by Settings:Protection:Body Diode Threshold , the device will automatically turn on the off-FET, to prevent 
further damage. This configuration register should be a positive value, it is used as a charging current level when 
deciding to turn on the DSG FET, and it is used as a discharging current level when deciding to turn on the CHG 
FET.
If the high-side NFET drivers will not be used in the application, the charge pump and FET 
drivers can be disabled by clearing the Settings:FET:Chg Pump Control[CPEN]  and Settings:FET:FET 
Options[FET_CTRL_EN]  configuration bits.
5.2.3 Protection FETs Configuration and Control
5.2.3.1 FET Configuration
The BQ76952 device supports both a series configuration and a parallel configuration for the protection FETs in 
the system, as well as a system which does not use one or both FETs. If the device FET drivers are not used 
at all, the charge pump should be disabled by clearing Settings:FET:Chg Pump Control[CPEN]  and clearing 
Settings:FET:FET Options[FET_CTRL_EN].  The Settings:FET:FET Options[SFET]  configuration bit should 
be set when FETs are used in a series configuration, and should be cleared if FETs are used in a parallel 
configuration. If the system will only use a single FET (such as a CHG FET with no DSG FET), the device can be 
configured for parallel configuration with the DFETF Permanent Fail disabled.
When a series FET configuration is used, the BQ76952 device provides body diode protection for the case when 
one FET is off and one FET is on. This situation might occur in SLEEP mode (when the DSG FET is on and the 
CHG FET may be off) or in a cell undervoltage fault condition, when the DSG FET may be off, but the CHG FET 
may still be on.
If the CHG FET is off, the DSG or PDSG FET is on, and a discharge current greater in magnitude than 
Settings:Protection:Body Diode Threshold  (that is, a significant discharging current) is detected, the device 
will turn on the CHG FET, to avoid current flowing through the CHG FET body diode and damaging the FET. 
When the current rises above the threshold (that is, less discharge current flowing), the CHG FET will be turned 
off again if the reasons for its turn-off are still present.
If the DSG FET is off, the CHG or PCHG FET is on, and a current in excess of + Settings:Protection:Body 
Diode Threshold  (that is, a significant charging current) is detected, the device will turn on the DSG FET, to 
avoid current flowing through the DSG FET body diode and damaging the FET. When the current falls below 
the threshold (that is, less charging current flowing), the DSG FET will be turned off again if the reasons for its 
turn-off are still present.
When a parallel configuration is used ( Settings:FET:FET Options[SFET]  = 0), the body diode protection is 
disabled.
5.2.3.2 FET Control
The protection FETs can be controlled in several different ways, depending on system requirements. If FETs will 
not be used in the system or driven from the device, the Settings:FET:FET Options[FET_CTRL_EN]  bit can be 
cleared, and the charge pump disabled by clearing the Settings:FET:Chg Pump Control[CPEN]  bit.
The device includes a FET Test mode for use during manufacturing, in which the device will not enable 
the FETs unless FET Test subcommands are sent. The device may still enable FETs based on body diode 
protection in this mode. The device is put into FET Test mode by clearing Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status 
Init[FET_EN] . The 0x0022 FET_ENABLE()  subcommand can be used to toggle the [FET_EN] bit setting. The 
FET Test subcommands are shown below.

Subcommand Description

0x0020 DSGTEST() Only functional in FET Test mode, toggles DSG FET state
In normal operation, the FETs can be controlled autonomously by the device or manually using FET Control 
subcommands from the host. The Settings:FET:FET Options[FET_CTRL_EN]  must be set for the device to 
enable the FETs at all. When this is set, the device will generally enable the FETs if there is nothing present 
which would block them, such as a protection fault or control from the host. Even if the host plans to control 
the FETs manually, the device may still change FET states based on the device settings, such as if body diode 
protection is enabled. If the intent is for the device to monitor and provide an interrupt or flag for a protection 
event, but the device is not to autonomously disable a FET in response to it, the appropriate configuration bit in 
Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections A – C  and Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections A – C  can 
be cleared. In this case, the host can monitor the interrupt or flags and decide whether to manually disable the 
FET.
For the CHG FET turnoff action to occur immediately when a fault is detected, the value of 
Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections A  should only be set to 0x18 or 0x98. Setting it to other values 
can cause FET turnoff action to be delayed by up to 250 ms in NORMAL mode or 1 second in SLEEP mode.
For the DSG FET turnoff action to occur immediately when a fault is detected, the value of 
Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections A  should only be set to 0x80 or 0xE4. Setting it to other values 
can cause FET turnoff action to be delayed by up to 250 ms in NORMAL mode or 1 second in SLEEP mode.
During normal operation, the host can disable the FETs by asserting the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins or by 
sending FET Control subcommands ( Table 5-8 ). When the FET Control subcommands are used to disable a 
FET, a signal is latched which blocks the FET from being enabled. In order to allow the FET to be re-enabled, 
it is first necessary to clear any signal blocking it. This can be accomplished by sending the appropriate FET 
Control subcommand (such as 0x0096 ALL_FETS_ON() ) to release a block created by an earlier subcommand. 
It is also necessary to ensure the CFETOFF or DFETOFF pins are deasserted. The FETs can only be enabled 
if nothing exists to block them (such as the latched FET Control subcommand signal, or the CFETOFF or 
DFETOFF signal asserted, or a separate enabled safety fault present).
The FET control subcommands for use during normal operation are shown below.
Table 5-8. FET Control Subcommands
Subcommand Description
0x0093 DSG_PDSG_OFF()Causes the DSG and PDSG FETs to be disabled. This subcommand should not be used if the DDSG pin 
is being used in DDSG mode.
0x0094 CHG_PCHG_OFF()Causes the CHG and PCHG FETs to be disabled. This subcommand should not be used if the DCHG pin 
is being used in DCHG mode.
0x0095 ALL_FETS_OFF() Causes the DSG, PDSG, CHG, and PCHG FETs to be disabled.
0x0096 ALL_FETS_ON() Allows all FETs to be enabled if nothing else is blocking them
0x0097 FET_CONTROL()An 8-bit field is sent with bits 3:0 matching those in 0x7F FET Status() . When a bit is set using this 
subcommand, the corresponding FET is blocked from being enabled. This subcommand should not be 
used if the DDSG or DCHG pins are being used in DDSG or DCHG mode.
For security purposes, the device can be set to either allow or ignore the host FET Control commands while in 
SEALED mode using Settings:FET:FET Options[HOST_FET_EN] .
The present status of the FET drivers is provided in 0x0057 Manufacturing Status()  subcommand, which 
includes the status bits described below.

5.2.3.2.1 PRECHARGE Mode
The BQ76952 device includes precharge functionality, which can be used to reduce the charging current for 
an undervoltage battery by charging using a high-side PCHG PFET (driven from the PCHG pin) with series 
resistor until the battery reaches a programmable voltage level. When the minimum cell voltage is less than 
Settings:FET:Precharge Start Voltage , the PCHG FET will be used for charging. Setting this threshold to 0 
disables PRECHARGE mode. PRECHARGE mode is deactivated when the minimum cell voltage reaches or 
exceeds a level given by Settings:FET:Precharge Stop Voltage . The status of the PCHG FET is provided in 
the 0x7F FET Status()[PCHG_FET]  register bit.
5.2.3.2.2 PREDISCHARGE Mode
The BQ76952 device includes predischarge functionality, which can be used to reduce inrush current when 
the load is initially powered, by first enabling a high-side PDSG PFET (driven from the PDSG pin) with series 
resistor, which enables the load to slowly charge. If PREDISCHARGE mode is enabled, whenever the DSG FET 
is turned on to power the load, the device will first enable the PDSG FET, then transition to turn on the DSG FET 
and turn off the PDSG FET. PREDISCHARGE mode is enabled when Settings:FET:FET Options[PDSG_EN]  is 
set.
When PREDISCHARGE mode is activated, the device remains in this mode until either a timeout is reached, 
or the voltage at the LD pin rises to within a programmable delta of the top-of-stack voltage, or both. The 
timeout can be set from 10 ms to 2550 ms in steps of 10 ms, using Settings:FET:Predischarge Timeout . If 
the timeout is set to 0, then the device does not use a timeout and exits PREDISCHARGE mode when the 
voltage condition is met. The voltage delta is programmable from 10 mV to 2550 mV in steps of 10 mV, using 
Settings:FET:Predischarge Stop Delta . If the voltage delta is set to 0, the device does not use a voltage 
condition and exits PREDISCHARGE mode based on the timeout.
Note
The voltage delta is checked by the device every 250 ms. The status of the PDSG FET is provided in 
the 0x7F FET Status()[PDSG_FET]  register bit.
If the Settings:FET:FET Options[PDSG_EN]  bit is set and the DFETOFF or BOTHOFF signal is asserted, the 
DSG and PDSG FETs are disabled, but the device is initially blocked from entering SLEEP mode (if already in 
SLEEP mode, the device returns to NORMAL mode when the signal is asserted). SLEEP mode can again be 
allowed if the host sends the DSG_PDSG_OFF()  or ALL_FETS_OFF()  subcommand, or a protection fault occurs 
(such as a Host Watchdog Fault or an OTF fault).
5.2.4 Cell Overvoltage Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates Cell Overvoltage Protection (COV), monitoring the voltage of every cell 
using a comparator-based circuit, and triggering a COV alert or fault when a cell voltage exceeds the 
COV threshold. The COV threshold is programmable from 1.012 V to 5.566 V in 50.6 mV steps and is 
set by the Protections:COV:Threshold  configuration register. The COV protection is enabled using the 
Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A:[COV]  configuration bit.
The COV circuitry triggers an alert signal when an overvoltage event is first detected, then will trigger a fault after 
a programmable detection delay, COV_DLY, which can be set from 10 ms to 6762 ms in units of 3.3 ms, with www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

the actual delay being 3.3 ms × (2 + setting). The setting 0x0 disables the protection. The delay is set by the 
Protections:COV:Delay  configuration register.
When a COV fault is triggered, it will recover if the maximum cell voltage drops below the COV threshold 
by a COV_HYS hysteresis level, which is programmable from 100 mV to 1 V in steps of 50 mV, for 
Protections:Recovery:Time . The COV_HYS hysteresis level is set by the Protections:COV:Recovery 
Hysteresis  configuration register.
When an COV fault is triggered, the device will turn off the CHG FET if configured for autonomous FET control 
based on setting in Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections A[COV]  (the DSG FET remains enabled if 
already enabled). The device will recover (if configured for autonomous FET control) based on all cell voltages 
being below COV threshold – COV_HYS for Protections:Recovery:Time .
The BQ76952 device also includes a Cell Overvoltage Latch (COVL) protection, which can create a fault 
if multiple COV failures occur within a programmable time window. Whenever a COV fault is triggered, the 
COVL latch counter is incremented. After the device recovers, it will decrement the COVL counter after a 
programmable recovery time window (given by Protections:COVL:Counter Dec Delay ) if no further COV faults 
are detected. If the COVL counter reaches a programmable latch limit (given by Protections:COVL:Latch 
Limit ), it will trigger a COVL fault.
The COVL protection recovers after a programmable delay given by Protections:COVL:Recovery Time , but 
it is important that Protections:COVL:Counter Dec Delay  be set shorter than Protections:COVL:Recovery 
Time , otherwise COVL would immediately trip again after recovery, since the COVL counter would not have 
decremented yet. The COVL protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections C:
[COVL]  configuration bit. Table 5-10  provides further details.

using a comparator-based circuit, and triggering a CUV alert or fault when a cell voltage falls below the 
CUV threshold. The CUV threshold is programmable from 1.012 V to 4.048 V in 50.6 mV steps and is 
set by the Protections:CUV:Threshold  configuration register. The CUV protection is enabled using the 
Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A:[CUV]  configuration bit.
The CUV circuitry triggers an alert signal when an undervoltage event is first detected, then triggers a fault after 
a programmable detection delay, CUV_DLY, which can be set from 10 ms to 6765 ms in units of 3.3 ms, with 
the actual delay being 3.3 ms × (2 + setting). The setting 0x0 disables the protection. The delay is set by the 
Protections:CUV:Delay  configuration register.
When a CUV fault is triggered, the fault will recover if the voltage rises above the CUV threshold by a value of 
CUV_HYS, which is programmable from 100 mV to 1 V in steps of 50 mV, for Protections:Recovery:Time . This 
hysteresis level is set by the Protections:CUV:Recovery Hysteresis  configuration register.
When CUV is triggered, the device turns off the DSG FET if configured for autonomous FET control, based on 
the setting in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections A[CUV]  (the CHG FET remains enabled if already 
enabled). The device recovers (if configured for autonomous recovery), based on all cell voltages being above 
CUV threshold + CUV_HYS. Table 5-12  provides further details.
Note
Timing on CUV changes while cell balancing is active, as described in Cell Balancing Loop Slow-down 
Setting .

5.2.6 Short Circuit in Discharge Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates Short Circuit in Discharge Protection (SCD) using a dedicated comparator that 
monitors the differential voltage across the SRN–SRP pins and triggers an SCD alert or fault when the voltage 
exceeds a programmable threshold VSCD. The VSCD threshold is programmable as 10 mV, 20 mV, 40 mV, 60 
mV, 80 mV, 100 mV, 125 mV, 150 mV, 175 mV, 200 mV, 250 mV, 300 mV, 350 mV, 400 mV, 450 mV, and 500 
mV, and is set by the Protections:SCD:Threshold  configuration register. The SCD protection is enabled using 
the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A:[SCD]  configuration bit.
The SCD circuitry triggers an alert signal when a short circuit event is first detected, then triggers a fault after 
a programmable detection delay, SCD_DLY, which can be set to fastest, or 15 µs to 450 µs in steps of 15 
µs. The fastest setting can result in detection of a short circuit with only comparator delay, which may be < 1 
µs depending on the overdrive of the threshold. The delay is set by the Protections:SCD:Delay  configuration 
register.
When an SCD fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET if configured for autonomous FET control 
in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections A . The CHG FET may also be disabled autonomously, based on 
the setting in Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections A . The device recovers (if configured for autonomous 
recovery) after a programmable delay given by Protections:SCD:Recovery Time .Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems www.ti.com

The BQ76952 device also includes a Short Circuit in Discharge Latch (SCDL) protection, which can create a 
fault and Permanent Fail (PF) if multiple SCD failures occur within a programmable time window. Whenever 
an SCD fault is triggered, the SCDL latch counter is incremented. After the device recovers, it decrements the 
SCDL counter after a programmable time of Protections:SCDL:Counter Dec Delay  if no further SCD faults are 
detected. If the SCDL counter reaches a programmable latch limit given by Protections:SCDL:Latch Limit , it 
triggers an SCDL fault and can also trigger an SCDL PF.
The SCDL protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections C:[SCDL]  configuration 
bit. If the SCDL protection fault is triggered, the device begins recovery if the load detect feature (see Load 
Detect Functionality ) is enabled and detects the load is removed, or if charging current is detected, or after a 
programmable time, or the host sends a 0x009C SCDL_RECOVER()  subcommand. In order to recover based 
on charging current, the Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[SCDL_CURR_RECOV]  must be set, 
the device must be in series FET configuration, and the CHG FET must be enabled. The device will begin 
recovery from SCDL if a current is detected greater than or equal to Protections:SCDL:Recovery Threshold 
for Protections:SCDL:Recovery Time  duration. If recovery is preferred based only on time, then the recovery 
based on charging current can be used, with the current threshold set to a small discharge current.
Note
"Beginning recovery" means the SCDL counter will begin decrementing every 
Protections:SCDL:Counter Dec Delay  interval if no new SCD faults occur.

5.2.7 Overcurrent in Charge Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates Overcurrent in Charge Protection (OCC) using a comparator that monitors the 
differential voltage across the SRP–SRN pins and triggers an OCC alert or fault when the voltage exceeds 
a programmable threshold VOCC. The VOCC threshold is programmable from 4 mV to 124 mV in 2 mV 
steps using the Protections:OCC:Threshold  configuration register. The OCC protection is enabled using the 
Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A:[OCC]  configuration bit.
The OCC circuitry triggers an alert signal when an overcurrent in charge event is first detected, then will trigger a 
fault after a programmable detection delay, OCC_DLY, which can be set from 10 ms to 426 ms in units of 3.3 ms, 
with the actual delay being 3.3 ms × (2 + setting). The setting 0x0 disables the protection. The delay is set by the 
Protections:OCC:Delay  configuration register.
When an OCC fault is triggered, the device will turn off the CHG FET if configured for autonomous FET control 
using Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections A.  (the DSG FET may remain enabled if already enabled). 
The device will recover (if configured for autonomous recovery) when the voltage measured on the PACK pin 
falls at least Protections:OCC:PACK-TOS Delta  below the voltage measured at the top-of-stack for a duration 
of Protections:Recovery:Time , or a current less than or equal to Protections:OCC:Recovery Threshold  (that 
is, a discharge current) is present for a duration of Protections:Recovery:Time .

5.2.8 Overcurrent in Discharge 1, 2, and 3 Protections
The BQ76952 device integrates Overcurrent in Discharge 1 (OCD1) and Overcurrent in Discharge 2 (OCD2) 
Protections using a comparator that monitors the differential voltage across the SRN–SRP pins and triggers 
an OCD1 or OCD2 alert or fault when the voltage exceeds a programmable threshold VOCD1 or VOCD2. 
The VOCD1 and VOCD2 thresholds are independently programmable from 4 mV to 200 mV in 2 mV 
steps using the Protections:OCD1:Threshold  and Protections:OCD2:Threshold  configuration registers. The 
OCD1 and OCD2 protections are enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A:[OCD1]  and 
Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections A:[OCD2]  configuration bits.
The OCD1 and OCD2 circuitry triggers an alert signal when an overcurrent in discharge event is first detected, 
then will trigger a fault when this condition persists for a programmable detection delay, OCD1_DLY or 
OCD2_DLY, which can be independently set from 10 ms to 426 ms in units of 3.3 ms, with the actual delay 
being 3.3 ms × (2 + setting). The delay is set by the Protections:OCD1:Delay  and Protections:OCD2:Delay 
configuration registers.
The device also integrates an Overcurrent in Discharge 3 (OCD3) Protection using the CC1 current 
measurement from the coulomb counter ADC, triggering an OCD3 alert or fault when the current 
is more negative (that is, an excessive discharge current) than a programmable threshold given by 
Protections:OCD3:Threshold . An alert signal is triggered when an overcurrent in discharge event is 
first detected, then a fault signal is triggered when this condition persists for a programmable detection 
delay, OCD3_DLY, which can be set from 0 sec to 255 sec in units of 1 sec. The delay is 
set by the Protections:OCD3:Delay  configuration register. The OCD3 protection is enabled using the 
Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections C:[OCD3]  configuration bit.
When an OCD1, OCD2, or OCD3 fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET if 
configured for autonomous FET control using Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections A[OCD2][OCD1] 
or Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections C[OCD3]  configuration bits. The device will recover when 
a charging current is detected greater than or equal to Protections:OCD:Recovery Threshold  for 
Protections:Recovery:Time  duration.
The BQ76952 device also includes an Overcurrent in Discharge Latch (OCDL) protection, which can create a 
fault if multiple OCD1 or OCD2 or OCD3 failures occur within a programmable time window. Whenever an OCD1 
or OCD2 or OCD3 fault is triggered, the OCDL latch counter is incremented. After the device recovers, it will 
decrement the OCDL counter after a programmable recovery time of Protections:OCDL:Counter Dec Delay  if 
no further OCD1, OCD2, or OCD3 faults are detected. If the OCDL counter exceeds a programmable latch limit 
given by Protections:OCDL:Latch Limit , it will trigger an OCDL fault. An OCDL alert is generated whenever 
the OCDL counter is greater than zero.
The OCDL protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections C:[OCDL]  configuration 
bit. If the OCDL protection fault is triggered, the device can recover if the load detect feature (see Section 
5.2.18 ) is enabled and detects the load is removed, or if charging current is detected, or after a programmable 
time, or the host sends a 0x009B OCDL_RECOVER()  subcommand. In order to recover based on charging 
current, the Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[OCDL_CURR_RECOV]  must be set, the device www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

5.2.9 Overtemperature in Charge Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates an Overtemperature in Charge (OTC) Protection that triggers an alert or fault 
when the cell temperature is greater than or equal to a programmable threshold TOTC. The TOTC threshold is 
programmable from -40°C to 120°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:OTC:Threshold  configuration register. 
The OTC protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B:[OTC]  configuration bit.
The OTC protection triggers an alert signal when an overtemperature in charge event is first detected, then will 
trigger a fault after a programmable detection delay, OTC_DLY, which can be set from 0-sec to 255-sec in units 
of 1-sec. The delay is set by the Protections:OTC:Delay  configuration register.
When an OTC fault is triggered, the device will turn off the CHG FET if configured for autonomous 
FET control, based on the setting in Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections B[OTC].  The device will 
recover when the temperature is less than or equal to the threshold set by Protections:OTC:Recovery  for

when the cell temperature is greater than or equal to a programmable threshold TOTD. The TOTD threshold is 
programmable from -40°C to 120°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:OTD:Threshold  configuration register. 
The OTD protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B:[OTD]  configuration bit.
The OTD protection triggers an alert signal when an overtemperature in discharge event is first detected, then 
will trigger a fault after a programmable detection delay, OTD_DLY, which can be set from 0-sec to 255-sec in 
units of 1-sec. The delay is set by the Protections:OTD:Delay  configuration register.
When an OTD fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET if configured for autonomous FET 
control, based on the setting in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections B[OTD] . The device will recover 
when the temperature is less than or equal to the temperature set by Protections:OTD:Recovery  for

The temperature used by the OTD protection is the maximum of all temperature readings that are designated for 
cell temperature, and can include the internal temperature measurement as well as all external thermistors which 
are enabled.
5.2.11 Overtemperature FET Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates an Overtemperature FET (OTF) Protection that triggers an alert or fault when 
the FET temperature is greater than or equal to a programmable threshold TOTF. The TOTF threshold is 
programmable from 0°C to 150°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:OTF:Threshold  configuration register. 
The OTF protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B:[OTF]  configuration bit.
The OTF protection triggers an alert signal when an overtemperature FET event is first detected, then will trigger 
a fault after a programmable detection delay, OTF_DLY, which can be set from 0-sec to 255-sec in units of 1-sec. 
The delay is set by the Protections:OTF:Delay  configuration register.
When an OTF fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET, the CHG FET, or both FETs if configured 
for autonomous FET control, based on settings in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections B[OTF]  and www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

5.2.12 Internal Overtemperature Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates an Internal Overtemperature (OTINT) Protection that triggers an alert or 
fault when the internal temperature is greater than or equal to a programmable threshold TOTINT. The 
TOTINT threshold is programmable from -40°C to 120°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:OTINT:Threshold 
configuration register. The OTINT protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections 
B:[OTINT]  configuration bit.

recovery) when the temperature is less than or equal to the threshold set by Protections:OTINT:Recovery  for 
Protections:Recovery:Time  duration.
5.2.13 Undertemperature in Charge Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates an Undertemperature in Charge (UTC) Protection that triggers an alert or fault 
when the cell temperature is less than or equal to a programmable threshold TUTC. The TUTC threshold is 
programmable from –40°C to 120°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:UTC:Threshold  configuration register. 
The UTC protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B:[UTC]  configuration bit.

The temperature used by the UTC protection is the minimum of all temperature readings that are designated for 
cell temperature, and can include the internal temperature measurement, as well as all external thermistors that 
are enabled.
5.2.14 Undertemperature in Discharge Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates an Undertemperature in Discharge (UTD) Protection that triggers an alert or 
fault when the cell temperature is less than or equal to a programmable threshold TUTD. The TUTD threshold is 
programmable from –40°C to 120°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:UTD:Threshold  configuration register. 
The UTD protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B:[UTD]  configuration bit.
The UTD protection triggers an alert signal when an undertemperature in charge event is first detected, then 
triggers a fault after a programmable detection delay, UTD_DLY, which can be set from 0 s to 255 s in units of 1 
second. The delay is set by the Protections:UTD:Delay  configuration register.
When a UTD fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET if configured for autonomous FET 
control, based on the setting in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections B[UTD] . The device recovers 
when the temperature is greater than or equal to the threshold set by Protections:UTD:Recovery  for 
Protections:Recovery:Time  duration.Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems www.ti.com

cell temperature, and can include the internal temperature measurement, as well as all external thermistors that 
are enabled.
5.2.15 Internal Undertemperature Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates an Internal Undertemperature (UTINT) Protection that triggers an alert or fault 
when the internal temperature is less than or equal to a programmable threshold TUTINT. The TUTINT threshold 
is programmable from -40°C to 120°C in 1°C steps using the Protections:UTINT:Threshold  configuration 
register. The UTINT protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections B:[UTINT] 
configuration bit.
The UTINT protection triggers an alert signal when an undertemperature in charge event is first detected, then 
will trigger a fault after a programmable detection delay, UTINT_DLY, which can be set from 0-sec to 255-sec in 
units of 1-sec. The delay is set by the Protections:UTINT:Delay  configuration register.
When a UTINT fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET, the CHG FET, or both FETs if configured 
for autonomous FET control, based on settings in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections B[UTINT]  and 
Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections B[UTINT] . The device will recover (if configured for autonomous 
recovery) when the temperature is greater than or equal to the threshold set by Protections:UTINT:Recovery 
for Protections:Recovery:Time  duration.
5.2.16 Host Watchdog Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates a Host Watchdog (HWD) Protection that triggers a fault when no 
communications are received for a programmable delay HWD_DLY. The HWD_DLY delay is programmable 
from 0-sec to 65535-sec in 1-sec steps using the Protections:HWD:Delay  configuration register. The HWD 
protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled Protections C:[HWDF]  configuration bit.
When an HWD fault is triggered, the device will turn off the DSG FET, the CHG FET, or both FETs if configured 
for autonomous FET control, based on settings in Settings:Protection:DSG FET Protections C[HWDF]  and 
Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections C[HWDF] . The device will recover (if configured for autonomous 
recovery) when valid communications are received. Note that there is no safety alert for the HWD, only a safety 
status in Safety Status C[HWDF] .
If there is a concern that the HWD fault is caused by the host processor no longer operating properly, 
the BQ76952 device can be configured to disable or toggle the external REG1 and REG2 LDOs when the 
fault occurs. Based on Settings:Configuration:HWD Regulator Options , the device can either leave the 
LDOs unchanged, disable the LDOs indefinitely, or disable the LDOs for a time period up to 15-sec, then re-
enable them again. This is controlled using the Settings:Configuration:HWD Regulator Options  configuration 
register.
Note: if the toggling is enabled and the device disables the LDOs after a HWD fault, after the toggle delay 
is completed the device will recover the LDOs to their state in Settings:REG12 Config[REG1_EN] and 
[REG2_EN] , which may not be their state when the HWD fault occurred.
5.2.17 Precharge Timeout Protection
The BQ76952 device integrates a Precharge Timeout (PTO) Protection that triggers a fault when the device has 
been in PRECHARGE mode for a time duration PTO_DLY. The PTO_DLY duration is programmable from 0-sec 
to 65535-sec in 1-sec steps using the Protections:PTO:Delay  configuration register. The timer for PTO_DLY 
only increments while the device is in PRECHARGE mode and the CC1 current exceeds a threshold given by 
Protections:PTO:Charge Threshold . When the device is in PRECHARGE mode and the current is less than or 
equal to this threshold, the Precharge Timeout Suspend bit ( Safety Alert C()[PTOS] ) is set. If the timer reaches 
the threshold given by Protections:PTO:Delay , the Precharge Timeout fault is triggered. The PTO timer is 
reset if a continuous discharge occurs with current larger in magnitude than Settings:Current Thresholds:Dsg 
Current Threshold  and an amount of charge is accumulated equal or greater than a programmable level 
given by Protections:PTO:Reset . The PTO protection is enabled using the Settings:Protection:Enabled 
Protections C:[PTO]  configuration bit.www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

When a PTO fault is triggered, the device will turn off the PCHG FET if configured for autonomous FET control, 
based on the setting in Settings:Protection:CHG FET Protections C[PTO] . PRECHARGE mode cannot restart 
until this fault is cleared by sending the 0x008A PTO_RECOVER()  subcommand.
5.2.18 Load Detect Functionality
When a Short Circuit in Discharge Latch or Overcurrent in Discharge Latch protection fault has occurred and the 
DSG FET is off, the device can be configured to recover when load removal is detected. This feature is useful if 
the system has a removable pack, such that the user can remove the pack from the system when a fault occurs, 
or if the effective system load that remains on the battery pack is higher than ≈20-kΩ when the DSG FET is 
disabled. The device will periodically enable a current source out the LD pin and will recover the fault if a voltage 
is detected at the LD pin above a 4 V level. If a low-impedance load is still present on the pack, the voltage the 
device measures on the LD pin will generally be below 4 V, preventing recovery based on Load Detect. If the 
pack has been removed from the system and the effective load is high, such that the current source generates 
a voltage on the LD pin above a 4 V level, then the device can recover from the fault. Note: typically a 10-kΩ 
resistor is connected between the PACK+ terminal and the LD pin, this resistance should be comprehended 
when considering the load impedance.
The Load Detect current is enabled for a time duration given by Protections:Load Detect:Active Time , then is 
disabled for a time duration given by Protections:Load Detect:Retry Delay , with this sequence repeating until 
the load has been detected as removed, or the accumulated time reaches Protections:Load Detect:Timeout . 
The timeout is included to prevent the device continuously attempting Load Detect indefinitely and causing long-
term drain on the pack. If the timeout is met, the Load Detect function will no longer operate until the latched 
faults have recovered through another means, or the 0x009D LOAD_DETECT_RESTART() subcommand to 
restart the Load Detect is received.
If the Protections:Load Detect:Active Time  is set to 0, then the Load Detect function is disabled. If the 
Protections:Load Detect:Retry Delay  is set to 0, then the Load Detect current source will remain on 
continuously until timeout or recovery occurs.
The Load Detect current can be forced on or off through subcommands. If the Protections:Load Detect:Active 
Time  is set to 0 and the 0x009E LOAD_DETECT_ON()  subcommand is sent, the Load Detect current source will 
be enabled. If the 0x009F LOAD_DETECT_OFF()  subcommand is sent, the Load Detect current source will be 
disabled.
When an SCDL or OCDL fault occurs and the DSG FET is disabled, the device may enter SLEEP mode, in 
which measurements of the LD pin voltage are only taken at intervals given by Power:Sleep:Voltage Time . It 
is recommended to set the Protections:Load Detect:Active Time  longer than Power:Sleep:Voltage Time , to 
be sure that during each window when the current source is enabled, at least one measurement of the LD pin 
voltage will occur. The status of the Load Detect function is provided in 0x00 Control Status()[LD_TIMEOUT, 
LD_ON] .
5.3 Secondary Protections
5.3.1 Secondary Protections Overview
The BQ76952 device integrates a suite of checks on battery operation and status that can trigger a Permanent 
Fail (PF) if conditions are considered so serious that the pack should be permanently disabled. The various 
PF checks can be enabled individually based on configuration settings, along with associated thresholds and 
delays for most checks. When a Permanent Fail has occurred, the BQ76952 device can be configured to 
either simply provide a flag (see PF Status A–D()  subcommands), or to indefinitely disable the protection FETs 
(if the Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_FETS]  bit is set), or to assert the FUSE pin (if the 
Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_FUSE]  bit is set) to permanently disable the pack. The 
FUSE pin can be used to blow an in-line fuse and also can monitor if a separate secondary protector IC has 
attempted to blow the fuse.
Since the device stores Permanent Fail status in RAM, that status would be lost when the device resets. To 
mitigate this, the device can write Permanent Fail status to OTP when the Settings:Protection:Protection 
Configuration[PF_OTP]  bit is set. OTP programming may be delayed in low-voltage and high-temperature 
conditions until OTP programming can reliably be accomplished. Note: writes to OTP during operation are Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems www.ti.com

only allowed if Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[OTPW_EN]  is set. If Settings:Protection:Protection 
Configuration[PF_OTP]  is set but Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[OTPW_EN]  is clear, Permanent 
Fail status is saved to RAM (and will be preserved during a partial reset) but will not be programmed to OTP. 
If Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_OTP]  is not set, Permanent Fail status will be lost on any 
reset, including a partial reset through the RST_SHUT pin.
The information that can be written to OTP when a Permanent Fail occurs includes the values of PF Status A ~ 
D and a Fuse Flag  byte, which indicates whether the fuse has been blown or not. This information can be read 
using the 0x0053 SAVED_PF_STATUS()  subcommand, which reports the information saved in RAM, even if the 
write to OTP has not yet completed.
Normally, a Permanent Fail causes the FETs to remain off indefinitely and the fuse may be blown. In that 
situation, no further action would be taken on further monitoring operations, and charging would no longer be 
possible. To avoid rapidly draining the battery, the device may be configured to enter DEEPSLEEP mode when a 
Permanent Fail occurs by setting the Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_DPSLP]  configuration 
bit. Entrance to DEEPSLEEP mode will still be delayed until after fuse blow and OTP programming are 
completed, if those options are enabled.
When a Permanent Fail occurs, the device may be configured to either turn the REG1 and REG2 LDOs off 
(if Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_REGS]  is set) or to leave them in their present state 
(if Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[PF_REGS]  is cleared). Once disabled, they may still be 
reenabled through command.
The Permanent Fail checks incorporate a programmable delay, to avoid triggering a PF fault on an intermittent 
condition or measurement. When the threshold is first detected as being met or exceeded by an enabled PF 
check, the device will set a PF Alert signal, which can be monitored using the PF Alert A–D()  commands and 
can also trigger an interrupt on the ALERT pin using the Alarm Status()[MSK_PFALERT]  register bit and its 
associated mask settings.
Note: the device only evaluates the conditions for Permanent Fail at one second intervals while in NORMAL and 
SLEEP modes, it does not continuously compare measurements to the Permanent Fail fault thresholds between 
intervals. Thus, it is possible for a condition to trigger a PF Alert if detected over threshold, but even if the 
condition drops back below threshold briefly between the one second interval checks, the PF Alert would not be 
cleared until it was detected below threshold at a periodic check.
A Permanent Fail can be cleared by issuing a full reset to the device. The now-obsolete PF_RESET() 
subcommand is no longer recommended for use.
5.3.2 Copper Deposition (CUDEP) Permanent Fail
When a cell is severely overdischarged, copper deposition can occur, resulting in very high impedance. If this 
occurs while the pack is in operation, the BQ76952 device will typically detect this and disable the pack before 
cells reach this low voltage (based on a SUV PF). However, if the device is in SHUTDOWN mode for an 
excessively long time period and the cells become overly discharged, the pack could still wake and enable 
the FETs if a charger were attached. If the FETs were turned on in this condition, the pack voltage would rise 
sharply due to the charging current, making the cells appear healthy. The CUDEP Permanent Fail is used to 
identify this condition and disable the pack. When enabled, this check keeps the FETs disabled at power up 
from SHUTDOWN mode until each cell voltage is greater than or equal to Permanent Fail:CUDEP:Threshold 
for Permanent Fail:CUDEP:Delay  seconds. If any cell voltage is below Permanent Fail:CUDEP:Threshold 
for Permanent Fail:CUDEP:Delay  seconds, the CUDEP Permanent Fail is triggered. This PF check is enabled 
by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF A[CUDEP]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status 
Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.3 Safety Undervoltage (SUV) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Safety Undervoltage (SUV) Permanent Fail, which can permanently 
disable the pack if any cell voltage reaches or falls below a programmable threshold for a programmable 
delay time. The threshold is set by Permanent Fail:SUV:Threshold , and the delay is set by Permanent 
Fail:SUV:Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF A[SUV]  and 
Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

5.3.5 Safety Overcurrent in Charge (SOCC) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Safety Overcurrent in Charge (SOCC) Permanent Fail, which can permanently 
disable the pack if the charging current reaches or exceeds a programmable threshold for a programmable 
delay time. The threshold is set by Permanent Fail:SOCC:Threshold , and the delay is set by Permanent 
Fail:SOCC:Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF A[SOCC] 
and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.6 Safety Overcurrent in Discharge (SOCD) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Safety Overcurrent in Discharge (SOCD) Permanent Fail, which can

programmable delay time. The threshold is set by Permanent Fail:SOCD:Threshold , and the delay is set by 
Permanent Fail:SOCD:Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled 
PF A[SOCD]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.7 Safety Cell Overtemperature (SOT) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Safety Cell Overtemperature (SOT) Permanent Fail, which can permanently 
disable the pack if the maximum cell temperature reaches or exceeds a programmable threshold for a 
programmable delay time. The threshold is set by Permanent Fail:SOT:Threshold , and the delay is set by 
Permanent Fail:SOT:Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF 
A[SOT]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.8 Safety FET Overtemperature (SOTF) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Safety FET Overtemperature (SOT) Permanent Fail, which can permanently 
disable the pack if the maximum FET temperature reaches or exceeds a programmable threshold for a

Permanent Fail:SOTF:Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled 
PF A[SOTF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.9 Charge FET (CFETF) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Charge FET (CFETF) Permanent Fail, which can permanently disable the 
pack if a charging current is measured that reaches or exceeds a programmable threshold for a programmable 
delay time while the charge FET is disabled. The threshold is set by Permanent Fail:CFETF:OFF Threshold , 
and the delay is set by Permanent Fail:CFETF:OFF Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the 
Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF B[CFETF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]

5.3.10 Discharge FET (DFETF) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Discharge FET (DFETF) Permanent Fail, which can permanently disable the 
pack if a discharge current is measured that reaches or exceeds a programmable threshold for a programmable 
delay time while the discharge FET is disabled. The threshold is set by Permanent Fail:DFETF:OFF 
Threshold , and the delay is set by Permanent Fail:DFETF:OFF Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting

device monitors the level of the FUSE pin each second (in NORMAL and SLEEP modes), and if it detects the 
pin is being asserted by the secondary protector for Permanent Fail:2LVL:Delay  seconds, a 2LVL PF fault

Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.12 Voltage Imbalance in Relax (VIMR) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Voltage Imbalance in Relax (VIMR) Permanent Fail, which can permanently 
disable the pack if an excessive level of cell imbalance is detected while the pack is in a relax state, which 
is determined by the absolute value of measured current being less than Permanent Fail:VIMR:Max Relax 
Current . The VIMR PF is only checked if the maximum cell voltage is above Permanent Fail:VIMR:Check 
Voltage  and the absolute value of measured current is less than Permanent Fail:VIMR:Max Relax Current  for 
a time duration of at least Permanent Fail:VIMR:Relax Min Duration . This check will generate a PF fault when 
a cell imbalance (that is, the difference in the maximum and minimum cell voltages) is detected that meets or 
exceeds Permanent Fail:VIMR:Threshold  for a time duration of Permanent Fail:VIMR:Delay . This PF check 
is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF B[VIMR]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg 
Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.13 Voltage Imbalance in Active (VIMA) Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Voltage Imbalance in Active (VIMA) Permanent Fail, which can permanently 
disable the pack if an excessive level of cell imbalance is detected while the pack is in a charging state, 
which is determined by the measured current meeting or exceeding Permanent Fail:VIMA:Min Active 
Current . The VIMA PF is only checked if the maximum cell voltage is above Permanent Fail:VIMA:Check 
Voltage  and the measured current is not less than Permanent Fail:VIMA:Min Active Current . This check 
will generate a PF fault when a cell imbalance (that is, the difference in the maximum and minimum cell 
voltages) is detected that meets or exceeds Permanent Fail:VIMA:Threshold  for a time duration of Permanent 
Fail:VIMA:Delay . This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF B[VIMA]

5.3.14 Short Circuit in Discharge Latched Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a Latched Short Circuit in Discharge (SCDL) Permanent Fail, which can 
permanently disable the pack if an SCDL protection fault occurs (which indicates multiple Short Circuit in 
Discharge (SCD) protection faults have detected within a programmable time window). The settings that control 
the SCDL fault are explained in Section 5.2.6 . The SCDL Permanent Fail should only be enabled if the SCDL 
protection fault is configured to not allow recovery. This PF check is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF B[SCDL]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.15 OTP Memory Signature Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a signature check on the OTP memory that will be checked when the device 
boots and loads data from OTP, but only if the OTP memory is not entirely empty (which is the default 
configuration). If the OTP memory signature check fails, the device will not load any settings from OTP, it will 
instead boot and load the default configuration, which keeps the FETs turned off (but it will not blow the fuse) and 
the REG1 LDO disabled. Note that the OTP signature does not include the Manufacturing Data (available using 
the 0x0070 MANU_DATA()  subcommand) nor any PF status data which was written to OTP (which is read using 
the 0x0053 SAVED_PF_STATUS()  subcommand).
The OTP PF (OTPF) is enabled by default. It can be disabled by clearing the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF C[OTPF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
Note: the device also includes a check on the trim information stored within the device during factory test. If an 
error is detected in this information during boot, the device will directly begin the SHUTDOWN sequence.
5.3.16 Data ROM Memory Signature Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a signature check on the Data ROM, which contains default values for the Data 
Memory settings. This PF will be checked when the device loads data from the Data ROM, which occurs at 
initial powerup or device reset. The Data ROM PF (DRMF) can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF C[DRMF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

A data ROM signature can be calculated on demand by the host sending the DROM_SIG()  subcommand. 
The signature returned by this subcommand can be compared to the expected value by the host processor, if 
periodic checks are required. The device only asserts the DRMF Permanent Fail when the signature check is 
performed at powerup or reset, it will not assert this if an incorrect signature is returned from the host manually 
sending the DROM_SIG()  subcommand.
5.3.17 Instruction ROM Memory Signature Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a signature check on the Instruction ROM, which contains internal controller 
program code. This PF will be checked at initial powerup or device reset. The Instruction ROM PF (IRMF) can 
be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[IRMF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg 
Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
An instruction ROM signature can be calculated on demand by the host sending the IROM_SIG()  subcommand. 
The signature returned by this subcommand can be compared to the expected value by the host processor, if 
periodic checks are required. Note that the calculation of this signature takes approximately 9 ms, during which 
time the device will temporarily suspend ADC and coulomb counter measurements and will not respond to serial 
communications. The device only asserts the IRMF Permanent Fail when the signature check is performed at 
powerup or reset, it will not assert this if an incorrect signature is returned from the host manually sending the 
IROM_SIG()  subcommand.
5.3.18 LFO Oscillator Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device includes a separate hardware monitor circuit which determines if the LFO oscillator 
frequency deviates excessively from its expected value. If such a deviation is detected, the device can 
trigger an LFO Oscillator PF (LFOF) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the 
Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[LFOF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN] 
configuration bits.
5.3.19 Voltage Reference Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a diagnostic check on the voltage references used by the device. VREF2 is 
used by the coulomb counter and LDOs, including the REG18 LDO. The REG18 LDO voltage is periodically 
measured using the voltage ADC (using VREF1 as its reference) and can be read back in bytes 0–1 of the 
0x0075 DASTATUS5()  subcommand. This command should normally report a value of approximately 29137. 
If it differs significantly from this, it may indicate that one reference has changed in value significantly relative 
to the other, meaning reported measurements may no longer be accurate. This ratio is monitored periodically 
and, if the value is below 26223 or above 32051 for four seconds, the device can trigger a VREF PF (VREF) 
and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF 
C[VREF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits.
5.3.20 VSS Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device integrates a diagnostic check on the ADC input mux by periodically measuring the VSS 
voltage level using the voltage ADC. This measurement is reported in bytes 2-3 of the 0x0075 DASTATUS5() 
subcommand and should normally report a value that is near zero. If it differs significantly from this, it may 
indicate the ADC input mux has experienced an error, meaning reported measurements may no longer be 
accurate. This measurement is monitored by the device and, if not as expected, can trigger a VSS PF (VSSF) 
and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF 
C[VSSF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits, and the fail threshold and 
delay are set by Permanent Fail:VSSF:Fail Threshold  and Permanent Fail:VSSF:Delay .
5.3.21 Protection Comparator MUX Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device implements a periodic check on the input mux for the hardware protection comparator 
subsystem used for the OV, UV, OCC, OCD1, and OCD2 primary protections. If this check fails, it can trigger 
a Protection Comparator MUX Permanent Fail (HWMX) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled 
by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[HWMX]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status

5.3.22 Commanded Permanent Fail
The BQ76952 device includes the capability for the host to force a Permanent Fail by sending the 0x2857 
PF_FORCE_A()  subcommand followed by the 0x29A3 PF_FORCE_B()  subcommand within 4 seconds. This 
PF is only allowed if the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[CMDF]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg

5.3.23 Top of Stack Measurement Check
The voltage ADC regularly measures the top of stack voltage through an internal divider and reports this 
in 0x34 Stack Voltage() . It also compares this measurement to the sum of the individual cell voltage 
measurements and can trigger a Top of Stack PF (TOSF) and disable the battery pack if they differ 
excessively. This PF can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF D[TOSF]  and 
Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits, and the fail threshold and delay are set by 
Permanent Fail:TOS:Threshold  and Permanent Fail:TOSF:Delay . This check is not performed if the current is 
beyond Power:Sleep:Sleep Current , in order to avoid false triggers due to a dynamic load.
5.3.24 Cell Open Wire
The BQ76952 device supports detection of a broken connection between a cell in the pack and the cell 
attachment to the PCB containing BQ76952. Without this check, the voltage at the cell input pin of the BQ76952 
device may persist for some time on the board-level capacitor, leading to incorrect voltage readings. The Cell 
Open Wire detection in the BQ76952 device operates by enabling a small current source from each cell to VSS 
at programmable intervals. If a cell input pin is floating due to an open wire condition, this current will discharge 
the capacitance, causing the voltage at the pin to slowly drop. This drop in voltage will eventually trigger a Cell 
Undervoltage protection fault on that particular cell, as well as a Cell Overvoltage protection fault on the cell 
above it. Eventually, the voltage will drop low enough to trigger a Safety Undervoltage PF on the particular cell, 
or a Safety Overvoltage PF on the cell above it. It is important that the undervoltage and overvoltage protections 
and PFs be enabled with appropriate threshold settings for the open wire condition to be detected and the 
desired reaction initiated.
The Cell Open Wire current will be enabled at a periodic interval set by the Settings:Cell Open-Wire:Check 
Time  configuration register, with a setting of 0 disabling this check entirely. The current source is enabled 
once every interval for a duration of the ADC measurement time (which is 3 ms by default). This provides 
programmability in the average current drawn from ≈0.65 nA to ≈165 nA, based on the typical current level of 
55 µA. After each Check Time  interval completes, during the next measurement loop the cell open wire current 
source is enabled on the cell above the cell being measured (with the current source enabled on the lowest cell 
while the topmost cell is being measured). This is scheduled to avoid the cell open wire current corrupting the 
cell voltage measurements. During SLEEP mode, the cell open wire current source is enabled in similar fashion 
during the next set of measurements that occur after the timer has expired.
Note: the Cell Open Wire check can create cell imbalance, so the settings should be selected appropriately.www.ti.com Primary and Secondary Protection Subsystems

6.3 LDOs
The BQ76952 device contains an integrated 1.8 V LDO (REG18) that provides a regulated 1.8 V supply voltage 
for the device's internal circuitry and digital logic. This regulator uses an external capacitor connected to the 
REG18 pin, and it should only be used for internal circuitry.
The device also integrates two separately programmable LDOs (REG1 and REG2) for external circuitry, such 
as a host processor or external transceiver circuitry, which can be programmed to independent output voltages. 
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs take their input from the REGIN pin, with this voltage either provided externally or 
generated by an on-chip pre-regulator (referred to as REG0). The REG1 and REG2 LDOs can provide an output 
current of up to 45 mA each.
6.3.1 Preregulator Control
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs take their input from the REGIN pin, which should be approximately 5.5 V. This 
REGIN pin voltage can be supplied externally (such as by a separate DC/DC converter) or using the integrated 
voltage preregulator (referring to as REG0), which drives the base of an external NPN BJT (using the BREG pin) 
to provide the 5.5 V REGIN pin voltage. When the preregulator is in use, special care should be taken to ensure 
the device retains sufficient voltage on its BAT pin, per the device electrical specifications.
The preregulator is only powered if Settings:Configuration:REG0 Config[REG0_EN]  is set as well as one of 
Settings:Configuration:REG12 Config[REG1_EN]  or Settings:Configuration:REG12 Config[REG2_EN]  are 
set, otherwise the device will not enable the preregulator.
If neither REG1 nor REG2 will be used in the system or if the REGIN voltage will be supplied externally, the 
Settings:Configuration:REG0 Config[REG0_EN]  configuration bit should be cleared.
Note
There is a diode connection between the REGIN pin (anode) and the BAT pin (cathode), so the 
voltage on REGIN should not exceed the voltage on BAT.
6.3.2 REG1 and REG2 LDO Controls
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs in the BQ76952 device are for customer use, and their output 
voltages can be programmed independently to 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.0 V, 3.3 V, or 5.0 V. The 
voltage levels are selected using the Settings:Configuration:REG12 Config[REG1V_2:REG1V_0]  and 
Settings:Configuration:REG12 Config[REG2V_2:REG2V_0]  configuration bits as shown below. The LDOs 
are enabled using the Settings:Configuration:REG12 Config[REG1_EN]  and Settings:Configuration:REG12 
Config[REG2_EN]  configuration bits, and their settings can be modified during operation using the 0x0098 
REG12_CONTROL()  subcommand. This subcommand takes an 8-bit value that matches the bits in the 
Settings:Configuration:REG12 Config  configuration register. It is important that the voltage selection not be 
changed in CONFIG_UPDATE mode while the LDO is enabled.
Table 6-3. REG1 and REG2 LDO Voltage Settings

0x0–0x3 1.8
0x4 2.5
0x5 3.0
0x6 3.3
0x7 5.0
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs and the REG0 pre-regulator are disabled by default in the BQ76952 device, 
with the REG1 and REG2 pulled to VSS with an internal resistance of ≈2.5-kΩ. If the pull-up resistors for the 
serial communications are connected to the REG1 voltage output, the REG1 voltage can be overdriven from 
an external voltage supply on the manufacturing line, to allow communications with the device. The BQ76952 
device can then be programmed to enable REG0 and REG1 with the desired configuration, and this setting can www.ti.com Device Status and Controls

be programmed into OTP memory. Thus, at each later power-up, the device will autonomously load the OTP 
settings and enable the LDO as configured, without requiring communications first.
6.4 Multifunction Pin Controls
The BQ76952 device provides flexibility regarding the multifunction pins on the device, which includes the TS1, 
TS2, TS3, CFETOFF, DFETOFF, ALERT, HDQ, DCHG, and DDSG pins. Several of the pins can be used as 
active-high outputs with configurable output level. The digital output driver for these pins can be configured 
to drive an output powered from the REG1 LDO or from the internal REG18 LDO, and thus when asserted 
active-high will drive out the voltage of the selected LDO.
Note: the REG18 LDO is not capable of driving high current levels, so it is recommended to only use this LDO 
to provide a digital output if it will be driving a very high resistance (such as > 1 MΩ) or light capacitive load. 
Otherwise the REG1 should be powered and used to drive the output signal.
The options supported on each pin include:
ALERT
Alarm interrupt output. It can be configured as follows:
Hi-Z when no alarm is triggered, versus driven low when triggered.
Driven high when no alarm is triggered, versus driven low when triggered.
Driven low when no alarm is triggered, versus driven high when triggered.
HDQ communications
Can be used for HDQ communications with a host processor.
CFETOFF
Input to control the CHG FET (that is, CFETOFF functionality). It can be configured as follows:
A high input forces the CHG FET off, a low input allows the CHG FET to be turned on (by host or device itself).
A low input forces the CHG FET off, a high input allows the CHG FET to be turned on (by host or device itself).
DFETOFF
Input to control the DSG FET (that is, DFETOFF functionality). It can be configured as follows:
A high input forces the DSG FET off, a low input allows the DSG FET to be turned on (by host or device itself).
A low input forces the DSG FET off, a high input allows the DSG FET to be turned on (by host or device itself).
Input to control both the DSG and CHG FETs (that is, BOTHOFF functionality). It can be configured as follows:
A high input forces both FETs off, a low input allows the FETs to be turned on (by host or device itself).
A low input forces both FETs off, a high input allows the FETs to be turned on (by host or device itself).

asserted, the device disables the respective protection FET. Note: when the selected pin is deasserted, the 
respective FET will only be enabled if there are no other items blocking them being re-enabled, such as if the 
host also sent a 0x0097 FET_CONTROL()  subcommand to disable the FETs using the serial communications 
interface after setting the selected pin. Both the CFETOFF and DFETOFF pins can be used for other functions if 
the FET turnoff feature is not required.
The CFETOFF pin can optionally be used to disable the CHG and PCHG FETs, and the DFETOFF pin can 
optionally be used to disable the DSG and PDSG FETs. The device also includes the option to configure the 
DFETOFF pin as BOTHOFF functionality, such that if that pin is asserted, the CHG, PCHG, DSG, and PDSG 
FETs will be disabled. This allows the CFETOFF pin to be used for an additional thermistor in the system, while 
still providing pin control to disable the FETs.
The CFETOFF or BOTHOFF functionality disables both the CHG FET and the PCHG FET when asserted.
The DFETOFF or BOTHOFF functionality disables both the DSG FET and the PDSG FET when asserted.
6.6 ALERT Pin Operation
The ALERT pin is a multifunction pin that can be configured either as ALERT (to provide an interrupt to a 
host processor), a thermistor input, a general purpose ADC input, a general purpose digital output, or an 
HDQ serial communication interface. The pin can be configured as active-high, active-low, or open-drain, to 
accommodate different system design preferences. When configured as the HDQ interface pin, the pin will 
operate in open-drain mode.
When the pin is configured to drive an active high output, the output voltage is driven from either the REG18 1.8 
V LDO or the REG1 LDO (which can be programmed from 1.8 V to 5.0 V). Note: if a DC or significant transient 
current may be driven by this pin, then the output should be configured to drive using the REG1 LDO, not the 
REG18 LDO.
The BQ76952 device includes functionality to generate an alarm signal at the ALERT pin, which can be 
used as an interrupt to a host processor. This functionality is optional, it can be enabled by setting the 
Settings:Configuration:ALERT Pin Config[PIN_FXN1:0]  = 0b10. When used for the alarm function, the pin 
can be programmed to drive the signal as an active-low or hi-Z signal, an active-high or low signal, or an 
active-low or high signal (that is, inverted polarity). The alarm function within the BQ76952 device includes a 
programmable mask, to allow the customer to decide which of many flags or events can trigger an alarm. The 
0x64 Alarm Raw Status()  command provides the present (unlatched) value of the bits described below:

Settings:Alarm:SF Alert Mask A–C , and Settings:Alarm:PF Alert Mask A–D  configuration registers. The host 
can poll 0x62 Alarm Status() , or use the alarm interrupt signal (the OR of all bits in 0x62 Alarm Status() ) mapped 
to the ALERT pin.
When bits are latched into 0x62 Alarm Status() , the host can read the status and clear those latched bits by 
writing the 0x62 Alarm Status()  command with a '1' in one or more of the bits to be cleared, and '0s' in all other 
bits (which leaves the other bits unchanged). This prevents unintentional clearing of any additional 0x62 Alarm 
Status()  bits that may have been set just before the clearing signal was sent from the host processor.
The 0x66 Alarm Enable()  command can be read to see the present mask applied to the 0x64 Alarm Raw 
Status()  bits. The 0x66 Alarm Enable()  command can also be written by the host to change the masking during 
operation.
The status of the ALERT pin is provided in the 0x7F FET Status()[ALRT_PIN]  register bit.
6.7 DDSG and DCHG Pin Operation
The BQ76952 device includes two multifunction pins, DDSG and DCHG, which can be configured as logic-level 
outputs to provide a fault-related signal to a host processor or external circuitry (that is, DDSG and DCHG 
functionality), as a thermistor input, a general purpose ADC input, or a general purpose digital output.
When used as a digital output, the pins can be configured to drive an active high output, with the output voltage 
driven from either the REG18 1.8 V LDO or the REG1 LDO (which can be programmed from 1.8 V to 5.0 V). 
Note: if a DC or significant transient current may be driven by a pin, then the output should be configured to drive 
using the REG1 LDO, not the REG18 LDO.
When the pins are configured for DDSG and DCHG functionality, they provide signals related to protection faults 
that (on the DCHG pin) would normally cause the CHG driver to be disabled, or (on the DDSG pin) would 
normally cause the DSG driver to be disabled. These signals can be used to control external protection circuitry, 
if the integrated high-side NFET drivers will not be used in the system. They can also be used as interrupts in 
manual FET control mode for the host processor to decide whether to disable the FETs using the CFETOFF and 
DFETOFF pins.
For example, if the DDSG pin is configured for DDSG functionality, and the cell overvoltage (COV) protection 
is enabled, the DDSG pin will be deasserted while there is no fault present. When a COV fault occurs, the 
DDSG pin will be asserted. When the device recovers from the COV fault, the DDSG pin will be deasserted. The 
polarity of the drive signal on the pin is also programmable.Device Status and Controls www.ti.com

When the DDSG and DCHG pins are configured for DDSG and DCHG functionality, they will assert or deassert 
as described above during NORMAL, SLEEP, and DEEPSLEEP modes of operation. The pins will be high-
impedance while the device is in SHUTDOWN mode.
6.8 Fuse Drive
The FUSE pin on the BQ76952 device can be used to blow a chemical fuse in the presence of a Permanent 
Fail (PF), as well as to detect if an external secondary protector in the system has detected a fault and is 
attempting to blow the fuse itself. The pin is intended to drive the gate of an NFET, which can be combined 
with the drive from an external secondary protector, as shown in Figure 6-1 . When the FUSE pin is not being 
asserted by the BQ76952 device, it remains in a high-impedance state and will detect a voltage applied at 
the pin by a secondary protector. If the Second Level Protector PF is enabled (using the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF B[2LVL]  and Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[PF_EN]  configuration bits), a PF 
will be generated if the device detects a high signal at the FUSE pin.
The device can be configured to blow the fuse when a PF occurs by setting the Settings:Protection:Protection 
Configuration[PF_FUSE]  configuration bit. If this is set, the device will only attempt to blow the fuse if the 
stack voltage is above a threshold given by Settings:Fuse:Min Blow Fuse Voltage , based on a system 
configuration with the fuse placed between the top of stack and the high-side protection FETs. If instead 
the fuse is placed between the FETs and the PACK+ connector, then the Settings:Protection:Protection 
Configuration[PACK_FUSE]  bit should be set, and the device will instead base its decision on the PACK Pin 
Voltage. This voltage threshold check will be disregarded if a FET Failure PF (CFETF or DFETF) has occurred 
and the Settings:Protection:Protection Configuration[FETF_FUSE]  bit is set.
When the FUSE pin is asserted to blow the external fuse, it will only stay asserted for a length of time set by the 
Settings:Fuse:Fuse Blow Timeout  configuration register.
The status of the FUSE pin is provided in the 0x12 Battery Status[FUSE]  bit.
The 0x001D FUSE_TOGGLE()  subcommand can be used to toggle the state of the FUSE pin drive.

7.1 Overview
The BQ76952 device has four operational modes to support optimized features and power dissipation, with the 
device able to transition between modes either autonomously or controlled by a host processor.
•NORMAL mode: In this mode, the device performs frequent measurements of system current, cell voltages, 
internal and thermistor temperatures, and various other voltages, operates protections as configured, and 
provides data and status updates.
•SLEEP mode: In this mode, the DSG FET is enabled, the CHG FET can optionally be disabled, and 
the device performs measurements, calculations, and data updates in adjustable time intervals. Battery 
protections are still enabled. Between the measurement intervals, the device is operating in a reduced power 
stage to minimize total average current consumption.
•DEEPSLEEP mode: In this mode, the CHG, PCHG, DSG, and PDSG FETs are disabled, all battery 
protections are disabled, and no current or voltage measurements are taken. The REG1 and REG2 LDOs 
can be kept powered, in order to maintain power to external circuitry, such as a host processor.
•SHUTDOWN mode: The device is completely disabled (including the internal, REG1, and REG2 LDOs), 
the CHG, PCHG, DSG, and PDSG FETs are all disabled, all battery protections are disabled, and no 
measurements are taken. This is the lowest power state of the device, which may be used for shipment or 
long-term storage. All register settings are lost when in SHUTDOWN mode.
The device also includes a CONFIG_UPDATE mode, which is used for parameter updates. Figure 7-1  shows the 
transitions between operational modes.Chapter 7

7.2 NORMAL Mode
NORMAL mode is the highest performance mode of the device, in which the device is making regular 
measurement of voltage, current, and temperature, the LFO (low frequency oscillator) is operating, and the 
internal processor powers up (as needed) for data processing and control. Full battery protections are operating, 
based on device configuration settings. System current is measured at intervals of 3 ms, with cell voltages 
measured at intervals of 63 ms or slower, depending on configuration. If the [FASTADC]  configuration bit is set, 
the conversion speed for both voltages and currents is doubled, with a reduction in measurement resolution.
The device will generally be in NORMAL mode whenever any active charging or discharging is underway. When 
the CC1 Current measurement falls below a SLEEP current threshold given by Power:Sleep:Sleep Current , the 
system is considered in RELAX mode, and the BQ76952 device can autonomously transition into SLEEP mode, 
depending on the configuration.
7.3 SLEEP Mode
SLEEP mode is a reduced functionality state that can be optionally used to reduce power dissipation when there 
is little or no system load current or charging in progress, but still provides voltage at the battery pack terminals 
to keep the system alive. At initial power up, the Settings:Configuration:Power Config[SLEEP]  configuration 
bit determines whether the device can enter SLEEP mode. After initialization, SLEEP mode can be allowed 
or disallowed using the 0x0099 SLEEP_ENABLE()  and 0x009A SLEEP_DISABLE()  subcommands. The 0x12 
Battery Status()[SLEEP_EN]  bit indicates whether the device is presently allowed to enter SLEEP mode or not, 
while the 0x12 Battery Status()[SLEEP]  bit indicates whether it is presently in SLEEP mode or not.
When the magnitude of the CC1 Current measurement falls below a current threshold given by 
Power:Sleep:Sleep Current , the system is considered in RELAX mode, and the BQ76952 device 
autonomously transitions into SLEEP mode, if settings permit. During SLEEP mode, comparator-based 
protections operate the same as during NORMAL mode. ADC-based current, voltage, and temperature 
measurements are taken every Power:Sleep:Voltage Time  seconds. While in SLEEP mode, the device also 
begins a 4-s, low-power current measurement 1 s—after completing voltage and temperature measurements—
which is used for accumulated charge integration while in SLEEP mode. When the Power:Sleep:Voltage Time Operational Modes www.ti.com

timer expires and a set of measurements is to be taken, the 4-s, low-power current measurement is stopped 
to enable the full measurement set to begin. To optimize the accumulated charge integration, the value of 
Power:Sleep:Voltage Time  can be set to 5 s or (4 × n + 1) seconds, which minimizes the time while the 4-s, 
low-power current measurement is stopped. All temperature protections use the ADC measurements taken at 
the Power:Sleep:Voltage Time  intervals, so they update at a reduced rate during SLEEP mode.
The BQ76952 device will exit SLEEP mode if a protection fault occurs, or current begins flowing, or a charger 
is attached, or the 0x009A SLEEP_DISABLE()  subcommand is sent, or if the RST_SHUT pin is asserted for < 
1 s. When exiting based on current flow, the device will quickly enable the FETs (if the CHG FET was off, or 
the DSG FET was in source follower mode), but the standard measurement loop is not restarted until the next 
1-s boundary occurs within the device timing. Therefore, new data may not be available for up to ≈1-s after the 
device exits SLEEP mode.
The coulomb counter ADC operates in a reduced power and speed mode to monitor current during SLEEP 
mode. The current is measured at periodic intervals and, if it exceeds Power:Sleep:Wake Comparator Current 
in magnitude, the device quickly transitions back to NORMAL mode. In addition to this check, if the 4-s current 
measurement taken at each Power:Sleep:Voltage Time  interval exceeds Power:Sleep:Sleep Current , the 
device will exit SLEEP mode.
The rate at which the coulomb counter ADC operates in this wake comparator mode is programmable using the 
Settings:Configuration:Power Config[WK_SPD_1:0]  configuration bits. These bits were originally designated 
reserved, with the bits denoted RSVD_1 and RSVD_0 in BQSTUDIO. By changing the conversion rate, the 
noise level of the resulting ADC conversions is also modified, with higher noise levels at faster conversion rates. 
The tables below summarize the bit name changes and settings.

(1) The coulomb counter digitizes the differential voltage between the SRP and SRN pins on the device. This measurement is converted 
to a current value for comparison with the Wake Comparator Current  threshold value. The measurement noise of the ADC is 
described here as the equivalent voltage measured between the SRP and SRN pins. The approximate noise current can be calculated 
by dividing this noise voltage level by the value of the sense resistor used in the system.
The setting WK_SPD[1:0]  = 0x0 provides the lowest noise level, with measurements exhibiting a sigma of 
approximately 6 μV, and a measurement taken every 48 ms. If a faster measurement rate is desired, then 
the setting 0x1 results in a sigma of approximately 10 μV and a measurement taken every 24 ms. If an 
even faster measurement rate is needed, the setting 0x3 can be used to provide a measurement every 6 ms. 
However, the sigma of this measurement is approximately 100 μV, which can result in unintentional wakeup from 
SLEEP mode if the threshold is set too low. For this reason, this setting is recommended only for use if the 
Power:Sleep:Wake Comparator Current  is set so that the differential voltage |V SRP – V SRN| > 1000 μV. Note 
that a six-sigma excursion using the 0x3 setting can cause a wakeup with a current approximately 600μV below 
the programmed threshold. The setting 0x2 (which is the default setting) may exhibit a large offset level and 
should not be used.
The device also monitors the PACK pin voltage and the top-of-stack voltage at each Power:Sleep:Voltage 
Time  measurement interval. If the PACK pin voltage is higher than the top-of-stack voltage by more than www.ti.com Operational Modes

Power:Sleep:Sleep Charger PACK-TOS Delta  and the top-of-stack voltage is less than Power:Sleep:Sleep 
Charger Voltage Threshold , the device will exit SLEEP mode. The BQ76952 device also includes a hysteresis 
on the SLEEP mode entrance, in order to avoid the device quickly entering and exiting SLEEP mode based on a 
dynamic load. After transitioning to NORMAL mode, the device will not enter SLEEP mode again for a number of 
seconds given by the Power:Sleep:Sleep Hysteresis Time  setting.
During SLEEP mode, the DSG FET can be driven either using the charge pump or in source-follower mode, as 
described in High-Side NFET Drivers . The CHG FET can be disabled or driven using the charge pump, based 
on the setting of Settings:FET:FET Options[SLEEPCHG] .
7.4 DEEPSLEEP Mode
The BQ76952 device integrates a DEEPSLEEP mode, which is a low power mode that allows the REG1 and 
REG2 LDOs to remain powered, but disables other subsystems. In this mode, the protection FETs are all 
disabled, so no voltage is provided at the battery pack terminals. All protections are disabled, and all voltage, 
current, and temperature measurements are disabled.
DEEPSLEEP mode can be entered by sending the 0x000F DEEPSLEEP()  subcommand twice in a row within 
a 4-sec time window. The device will exit DEEPSLEEP mode and return to NORMAL mode if the 0x000E 
EXIT_DEEPSLEEP()  subcommand is sent, or if the RST_SHUT pin is asserted for < 1-sec, or if a charger is 
attached (which is detected by the voltage on the LD pin rising from below V WAKEONLD  to exceed it). In addition, if 
the BAT pin voltage falls below V PORA –VPORA_HYS , the device transitions to SHUTDOWN mode.
When the device exits DEEPSLEEP mode, it first completes a full measurement loop and evaluates conditions 
relative to enabled protections, to ensure that conditions are acceptable to proceed to NORMAL mode. This may 
take ≈250 ms plus the time for the measurement loop to complete.
The REG1 and REG2 LDOs will maintain their power state when entering DEEPSLEEP mode if the 
Settings:Configuration:Power Config[DPSLP_LDO]  configuration bit is set. The device also provides the 
ability to keep the LFO running while in DEEPSLEEP mode, which allows for a faster responsiveness to 
communications and transition back to NORMAL mode, but will consume additional power. This is controlled by 
the Settings:Configuration:Power Config[DPSLP_LFO]  configuration bit.
Other than the 0x000E EXIT_DEEPSLEEP()  subcommand, communications with the device over the serial 
interface will not cause it to exit DEEPSLEEP mode. However, since no measurements are taken while in 
DEEPSLEEP mode, there is no new information available for readout. To collect measurement data without 
powering the system the user can do the following:
1.Send the 0x0095 ALL_FETS_OFF()  subcommand to keep the FETs disabled.
2.Send the 0x000E EXIT_DEEPSLEEP()  subcommand to transition back into NORMAL mode.
3.Wait for a measurement cycle to complete by monitoring the 0x62 Alarm Status()[FULLSCAN]  bit.
4.Read the data.
5.Send the 0x000F DEEPSLEEP()  subcommand twice within 4-sec to return to DEEPSLEEP mode.
6.Send the 0x0096 ALL_FETS_ON()  subcommand to unblock the FETs from being enabled when 
DEEPSLEEP mode is exited in the future.
7.5 SHUTDOWN Mode
SHUTDOWN mode is the lowest power mode of the BQ76952, which can be used for shipping or long-term 
storage. In this mode, the device loses all register state information, the internal logic is powered down, 
the protection FETs are all disabled, so no voltage is provided at the battery pack terminals. All protections 
are disabled, all voltage, current, and temperature measurements are disabled, and no communications are 
supported. When the device exits SHUTDOWN, it will boot and read parameters stored in OTP (if that has been 
written). If the OTP has not been written, the device will power up with default settings, and then settings can be 
changed by the host writing device registers.
Entering SHUTDOWN mode involves a sequence of steps. The sequence can be initiated manually by 
sending the 0x0010 SHUTDOWN()  subcommand twice in a row within a 4-s time window if the device is 
SEALED. The subcommand is only required to be sent once if in UNSEALED or FULLACCESS modes. If 
this subcommand is sent twice in a row while the device is in UNSEALED or in FULLACCESS modes, the Operational Modes www.ti.com

================================================================================

delays associated with the sequence are skipped. The device can also be configured to enter SHUTDOWN 
mode automatically based on the top of stack voltage or the minimum cell voltage. If the top-of-stack 
voltage falls below Power:Shutdown:Shutdown Stack Voltage  or if the minimum cell voltage falls below 
Power:Shutdown:Shutdown Cell Voltage , the SHUTDOWN mode sequence is automatically initiated. The 
shutdown based on cell voltage does not apply to cell input pins being used to measure interconnect, based on 
settings in Settings:Configuration:Vcell mode .
Note
If this feature is enabled and cell open-wire detection is also enabled, an open-wire condition may 
result in the device entering SHUTDOWN mode before an open-wire fault can be recorded, unless 
delays are set appropriately. If an automatic shutdown has been started based on the cell or stack 
voltage, and the voltage measured on the PACK pin is equal or above the top-of-stack (TOS) voltage 
by a threshold given by Power:Sleep:Sleep Charger PACK-TOS Delta , the device will return to 
NORMAL mode, which allows the pack to be charged out of a low voltage condition.
While the BQ76952 device is in NORMAL or SLEEP mode, the device can also be configured to 
enter SHUTDOWN mode if the internal temperature measurement exceeds Power:Shutdown:Shutdown 
Temperature  for Power:Shutdown:Shutdown Temperature Delay  seconds.
When the SHUTDOWN mode sequence has been initiated by the 0x0010 SHUTDOWN()  subcommand or the 
RST_SHUT pin driven high for 1 s, the device will wait for Power:Shutdown:FET Off Delay  then disable 
the protection FETs. After a delay of Power:Shutdown:Shutdown Command Delay  from when the sequence 
begins, the device will enter SHUTDOWN mode (so Power:Shutdown:Shutdown Command Delay  should 
be set longer than Power:Shutdown:FET Off Delay ). However, if the voltage on the LD pin is still above the 
VWAKEONLD  level, shutdown will be delayed until the voltage on LD falls below that level.
Note
When SHUTDOWN mode is initiated in this manner, the device will first transition to NORMAL mode 
and will block entrance to SLEEP mode. If the FETs were initially off (such as if the device was in 
DEEPSLEEP mode) and Power:Shutdown:FET Off Delay  = 0, the FETs will remain off. However, 
if Power:Shutdown:FET Off Delay  > 0, the FETs may be enabled (if not blocked) upon entering 
NORMAL mode, then disabled after the Power:Shutdown:FET Off Delay . If this is not preferred, the 
host can send the 0x0095 ALL_FETS_OFF()  before entering DEEPSLEEP mode, then can send the 
0x0096 ALL_FETS_ON()  when exiting DEEPSLEEP mode.
While the device is in SHUTDOWN mode, a ≈5 V level is provided at the TS2 pin with high source impedance. 
If the TS2 pin is pulled below V WAKEONTS2 , such as by a switch to VSS, or if a voltage is applied at the LD 
pin above V WAKEONLD  (such as when a charger is attached in series FET configuration), the device will exit 
SHUTDOWN mode.
Note
If a thermistor is attached from the TS2 pin to VSS, it prevents the device from ever fully entering 
SHUTDOWN mode.
As a countermeasure to avoid an unintentional wake from SHUTDOWN mode when putting the BQ76952 
device into long-term storage, the device can be configured to automatically reenter SHUTDOWN mode after 
Power:Shutdown:Auto Shutdown Time  minutes if the device boots from SHUTDOWN mode without any valid 
communications occurring or any charge or discharge current detected. This feature is disabled by default, so it 
is necessary to program it enabled in OTP to ensure it is enabled when an unintentional wake occurs. It also will 
not take effect after a watchdog reset has occurred. See Power:Shutdown:Auto Shutdown Time  for more details.www.ti.com Operational Modes

The BQ76952 device performs periodic memory integrity checks and will force a watchdog reset if any corruption 
is detected. To avoid a cycle of resets in the case of a memory fault, the device will enter SHUTDOWN mode 
rather than resetting if a memory error is detected within Power:Shutdown:RAM Fail Shutdown Time  seconds 
after a watchdog reset has occurred.
When the device is wakened from SHUTDOWN, it requires approximately 200-300 ms (if Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF A[CUDEP]  is not enabled) for the internal circuitry to power up, load settings from OTP 
memory, perform initial measurements, evaluate those relative to enabled protections, then to enable FETs if 
conditions allow. This can be much longer if [CUDEP]  is enabled, depending on its associated delay setting in 
Permanent Fail:CUDEP:Delay .
The BQ76952 device integrates a hardware overtemperature detection circuit, which determines when the die 
temperature passes an excessive temperature of approximately 120°C. If this detector triggers, the device will 
automatically begin the sequence to enter SHUTDOWN if the Settings:Configuration:Power Config[OTSD] 
configuration bit is set.
If the shutdown sequence has been initiated, but the TS2 pin is held below V WAKEONTS2 , or the voltage at the 
LD pin is above V WAKEONLD , then the device will stay in a "soft shutdown" state until the TS2 pin voltage is 
no longer below V WAKEONTS2 , and the LD pin voltage is below V WAKEONLD . While in "soft shutdown," FETs are 
disabled, protections and measurements are stopped, and serial communication is disabled. The device will exit 
"soft shutdown" if the LD voltage is allowed to first fall below V WAKEONLD , then was raised above V WAKEONLD  by 
a charger being attached, or if the RST_SHUT pin is transitioned from low to high, or the conditions allow the 
device to continue into SHUTDOWN mode. V WAKEONLD  and V WAKEONTS2  are specified in the BQ76952 3-Series 
to 16-Series High Accuracy Battery Monitor and Protector for Li-Ion, Li-Polymer, and LiFePO 4 Battery Packs 
Data Sheet  (SLUSE13 ).
7.6 CONFIG_UPDATE Mode
The BQ76952 device uses a special CONFIG_UPDATE mode to make changes to the data memory settings. 
If changes were made to the data memory settings while the firmware was in normal operation, it could result 
in unexpected operation or consequences if settings used by the firmware changed in the midst of operation. 
When changes to the data memory settings are needed (which generally should only be done on the customer 
manufacturing line or in an offline condition), the host should:
Place the device into CONFIG_UPDATE mode by sending the 0x0090 ENTER_CFG_UPDATE()  subcommand. The device will then 
automatically disable the protection FETs if they are enabled.
Wait for the 0x12 Battery Status()[CFGUPDATE]  flag to set.
Modify settings as needed by writing updated data memory settings (for more information, see Data Memory Access ).
Send the 0x0092 EXIT_CFG_UPDATE()  command to resume firmware operation.
When in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, the device stops normal firmware operation and stops all measurements and 
protection monitoring. The host can then make changes to data memory settings (either writing registers directly 
into RAM, or instructing the device to program the RAM data into OTP). After changes are complete, the host 
then sends the 0x0092 EXIT_CFG_UPDATE()  command, at which point the device restarts normal firmware 
operation using the new data memory settings.Operational Modes www.ti.com

8.1 Overview
The BQ76952 device includes three security modes: SEALED, UNSEALED, and FULLACCESS, which can be 
used to limit the ability to view or change settings.
In SEALED mode, most data and status can be read using commands and subcommands, but only selected 
settings can be changed. Data memory settings cannot be read or changed directly.
UNSEALED mode includes SEALED functionality, and also adds the ability to execute additional subcommands 
and read data memory.
FULLACCESS mode allows capability to read and modify all device settings, including writing OTP memory.
Selected settings in the device can be modified while the device is in operation through supported commands 
and subcommands, but in order to modify all settings, the device must enter CONFIG_UPDATE mode (see 
Section 7.6), which stops device operation while settings are being updated. After the update is completed, 
device operation is restarted using the new settings. CONFIG_UPDATE mode is only available in FULLACCESS 
mode.
The BQ76952 device implements a key-access scheme to transition among SEALED, UNSEALED, and 
FULLACCESS modes. Each transition requires that a unique set of keys be sent to the device through the 
subcommand address (0x3E and 0x3F). The keys must be sent consecutively to 0x3E and 0x3F, with no other 
data written between the keys. Do not set the two keys to identical values. When in the SEALED mode, the 0x12 
Battery Status()[SEC1, SEC0]  bits are set to [1, 1]. When the UNSEAL keys are correctly received by the device, 
the bits will be set to [1, 0]. When the FULLACCESS keys are correctly received, then the bits will change to [0, 
1]. The state [0, 0] is not valid, and only indicates that the state has not yet been loaded. The device must first 
transition from SEALED mode to UNSEALED mode before it can then transition to FULLACCESS mode.
The unseal keys are stored in data memory in Security:Keys:Unseal Key Step 1  and Security:Keys:Unseal 
Key Step 2 . The FULLACCESS keys are stored in Security:Keys:Full Access Key Step 1  and 
Security:Keys:Full Access Key Step 2 . The access keys are changed during operation using the 0x0035 
SECURITY_KEYS()  subcommand. This subcommand enables a R/W of the 4 key words (8 bytes). Each word 
is sent in big endian order using this subcommand, with the first two words being the unseal code and the 
remaining two words being the full access codes.
When using the codes by writing them to 0x3E and 0x3F, they must be sent in little endian order; therefore, 
if 0x1234 and 0x5678 are written as the unseal codes to 0x0035 SECURITY_KEYS() , then to unseal requires 
writing 0x34 and 0x12 to 0x3E and 0x3F, followed by writing 0x78 and 0x56 to 0x3E and 0x3F. The two codes 
must be written within 4 s of each other to succeed.
To read the keys:
1.Write 0x35 and 0x00 to 0x3E and 0x3F
2.Read back 8 bytes from the transfer buffer at 0x40–0x47.
To write the keys:
1.Write 0x35 and 0x00 to 0x3E and 0x3F.
2.Write the data in big endian format to the transfer buffer at 0x40–0x47.
3.Write the checksum to 0x60. The checksum is the complement of the sum of the data and command bytes.Chapter 8

4.Write the length of 0x0A to 0x61. The length includes the command, data, checksum, and length bytes.
To set the device into SEALED mode when initially powering up, the Security:Settings:Security 
Settings[SEAL]  configuration bit can be set. During operation, the device can be put into SEALED mode by 
sending the 0x0030 SEAL()  subcommand.
The BQ76952 device includes additional means to limit further modification of device settings. If the 
Security:Settings:Security Settings[LOCK_CFG]  configuration bit is set, the data memory settings can 
no longer be modified when the device is in CONFIG_UPDATE mode. If the Security:Settings:Security 
Settings[PERM_SEAL]  bit is set, the device cannot be unsealed after it has been sealed.
The device provides additional checks which can be used to optimize system robustness:
The 0x0004 IROM_SIG()  subcommand calculates a digital signature of the integrated instruction ROM, and the 
0x0009 DROM_SIG()  subcommand calculates a similar signature of the integrated data ROM (which contains 
the default values for the device). These signatures should never change for a particular product. If these were 
to change, it would indicate an error, either that the ROM had been corrupted, or the readback of the ROM or 
calculation of the signature experienced an error.
The 0x0005 STATIC_CFG_SIG()  subcommand calculates a digital signature for the static configuration data 
(which excludes calibration values) and compares it to a stored value. If the result does not match the stored 
signature, the MSB returned is set.Device Security www.ti.com

9.1 Serial Communications Overview
The BQ76952 device integrates three serial communication interfaces–an I2C bus, which supports 100 kHz and 
400 kHz modes with an optional CRC check, an SPI bus with an optional CRC check, which supports a clock 
rate up to 2 MHz, and a single-wire HDQ interface. The BQ76952 device is configured default in I2C mode 
(other versions of the device, such as the BQ7695201, may be configured in a different mode by default), and 
can be changed to SPI or HDQ mode by programming either the register or OTP configuration accordingly. The 
customer can program the device's integrated OTP on the manufacturing line to set the desired communications 
speed and protocol to be used at power up in operation.
The Settings:Configuration:Comm Type  configuration register controls the active communication mode of the 
BQ76952 device. These settings are shown below.

All other values Reserved. Do not use.
9.2 I2C Communications Subsystem
The I2C serial communications interface in the BQ76952 device acts as a responder device and supports rates 
up to 400 kHz with an optional CRC check. If the OTP has not been programmed, the BQ76952 will initially 
power up by default in 400 kHz I2C mode, while other versions of the device may have a different default 
setting (for example, the BQ7695201 will initially power up by default in SPI with CRC mode). The OTP setting 
can be programmed on the manufacturing line, then when the device powers up, it will automatically enter the 
selected mode per OTP setting. The host can also change the I2C speed setting while in CONFIG_UPDATE 
mode, then the new speed setting will take effect upon exit of CONFIG_UPDATE mode. Alternatively, the host 
can write the 0x29e7 SWAP_TO_I2C()  subcommand to change the communications interface to I2C fast mode 
(Settings:Configuration:Comm Type  = 8) immediately, without needing to enter CONFIG_UPDATE mode. The 
0x29BC SWAP_COMM_MODE()  subcommand can be sent to transition the device to the communications mode 
selected by the setting in Settings:Configuration:Comm Type .Chapter 9

The I2C device address is set by default as 0x10 (write), 0x11 (read), which can be changed by programming 
Settings:Configuration:I2C Address  with the desired write address.
The communications interface includes optional timeout capability which can be enabled based on the Comm 
Type  setting. The Comm Type  settings with timeouts should only be used if the bus will be operating at 100 
kHz or 400 kHz. If Comm Type = 0x1E (100 kHz mode with timeouts enabled), then the device will reset the 
communications interface logic if a clock is detected low longer than a t TIMEOUT  of 25 ms to 35 ms, or if the 
cumulative clock low responder extend time exceeds ≈25 ms, or if the cumulative clock low controller extend 
time exceeds 10 ms. If Comm Type = 0x09 (400 kHz mode with timeouts enabled), then the device will reset the 
communications interface logic if a clock is detected low longer than t TIMEOUT  of 5 ms to 20 ms. The bus also 
includes a long-term timeout if the SCL pin is detected low for more than 2 seconds, which applies whether the 
Comm Type  setting includes timeouts or not.
An I2C write transaction is shown in Figure 9-1 . Block writes are allowed by sending additional data bytes before 
the Stop. The I2C logic will auto-increment the register address after each data byte.
When enabled, the CRC is calculated as follows:
•In a single-byte write transaction, the CRC is calculated over the responder address, register address, and 
data.
•In a block write transaction, the CRC for the first data byte is calculated over the responder address, register 
address, and data. The CRC for subsequent data bytes is calculated over the data byte only.
The CRC polynomial is x8 + x2 + x + 1, and the initial value is 0. 
When the responder detects a bad CRC, the I2C responder will NACK the CRC, which causes the I2C responder 
to go to an idle state.

When a read transaction is sent by the host, the device may clock stretch while it fetches the data and prepares 
to send it. However, when subcommands are sent that require the device to fetch data and load it into the 0x40 
– 0x5F transfer buffer, the device does not clock stretch during this time. The timing required for the device to 
fetch the data depends on the specific subcommand and any other processing underway within the device, so 
it will vary during operation. The approximate times required for the device to fetch the data for subcommands 
are described in Table 9-2 . When sending a subcommand, it is recommended to wait long enough for the device 
to fetch the data, then read 0x3E/0x3F again. If the initial subcommand is echoed back from this read, then the 
fetched data is available and can be read from the transfer buffer.
9.3 SPI Communications Interface
The SPI interface in the BQ76952 device operates as a responder-only interface and supports rates up to 2 MHz 
with an optional CRC check. If the OTP has not been programmed, the BQ76952 will initially power up by default 
in 400 kHz I2C mode, while other versions of the device may initially power up in other modes, depending on 
the device version. The OTP setting to select SPI mode in the BQ76952 (set by Settings:Configuration:Comm 
Type ) can be programmed on the manufacturing line to select SPI mode, then when the device powers up, 
it will automatically enter SPI mode. The host can also change the serial communication setting while in 
CONFIG_UPDATE mode, although the device will not immediately change communication mode upon exit 
of CONFIG_UPDATE mode, in order to avoid losing communications during evaluation or production. The 
host can write the 0x7C35 SWAP_TO_SPI()  subcommand to change the communications interface to SPI 
with CRC ( Settings:Configuration:Comm Type  = 16) immediately, without needing to change the setting 
in CONFIG_UPDATE mode. Alternatively, the 0x29BC SWAP_COMM_MODE()  subcommand can be sent to 
transition the device to the communications mode selected by the setting in Settings:Configuration:Comm 
Type .
The SPI interface logic operates with clock polarity (CPOL) = 0 and clock phase (CPHA) = 0, as shown in the 
figure below.www.ti.com Serial Communications Interfaces

The device also includes an optional 8-bit CRC using polynomial x8 + x2 + x + 1. The interface must use 16-bit 
transactions if CRC is not enabled, and must use 24-bit transactions when CRC is enabled. CRC mode is 
enabled or disabled based on the setting of Settings:Configuration:Comm Type . Based on control settings, 
the logic will:
(a) only work with CRC, will not accept data without valid CRC, or
(b) will only accept transactions without CRC (so the host must only clock 16-bits per transaction, the device will 
detect an error if more or less clocks are sent).
If the host performs a write with CRC and the CRC is not correct, then the incoming data is not transferred to the 
incoming buffer, and the outgoing buffer (used for the next transaction) is also reset to 0xFFFF. This transaction 
is considered invalid. On the next transaction, the CRC (if clocked out) will be 0xAA, so the 0xFFFFAA will 
indicate to the controller that a CRC error was detected.
The internal oscillator in the BQ76952 device may not be running when the host initiates a transaction (for 
example, this can occur if the device is in SLEEP mode). If this occurs, the interface will drive out 0xFFFF on 
SPI_MISO for the first 16-bits clocked out. It will also drive out 0xFF for the third (CRC) byte as well, if CRC is 
enabled. So the 0xFFFFFF will indicate to the controller that the internal oscillator is not ready yet. The address 
0x7F used in the device is defined in such a manner that there should be no valid transaction to write 0xFF into 
this address. Thus the two-byte pattern 0xFFFF should never occur as a valid sequence in the first two bytes of 
a transaction (that is, it is only used as a flag that something is wrong, similar to an I2C NACK).
If the internal HFO oscillator is not running in the device, it will be automatically wakened at the falling edge 
of SPI_CS (this is true while in NORMAL, SLEEP, or DEEPSLEEP modes, but not in SHUTDOWN mode). In 
NORMAL mode or SLEEP mode the HFO may take ≈ 135 µs to stabilize and be available for use by the SPI 
interface logic. In DEEPSLEEP mode, the HFO will take ≈ 4.5 ms to stabilize and be available. This delay means 
that requested data generally cannot be provided back to the host during the first SPI transaction when the 
HFO was initially off. Thus, in cases when the HFO is likely initially off, it is recommended that the host first 
write a "dummy" SPI transaction to waken the HFO, then wait at least 135 µs while in NORMAL or SLEEP 
modes, or 4.5 ms while in DEEPSLEEP mode, before sending the intended SPI transaction. If a SPI transaction 
returns 0xFFFF (in 16-bit mode) or 0xFFFFFF (in 24-bit mode) while in NORMAL or SLEEP modes, the host 
should retry the transaction again after a delay of at least 135 µs, or 4.5 ms after initial powerup or while in 
DEEPSLEEP mode. This allows time for the HFO to waken, if it was initially off, and for the device to prepare the 
data requested and have it ready for readout.
It is recommended to set the Settings:Configuration:Comm Idle Time  to a level of 1 second or higher when 
using SPI mode, which causes the HFO to stay powered for a programmable number of seconds after it is 
wakened by a falling edge on SPI_CS. The host can set this to a longer time (up to 255 seconds) and maintain 
regular communications within this window, causing the HFO to stay powered, so the device can respond quickly 
to SPI transactions. However, keeping the HFO running continuously will cause the device to consume additional Serial Communications Interfaces www.ti.com

supply current (≈ 30 µA) beyond what it would consume if there were minimal communications. In order to avoid 
this extra supply current, the host can send initially send a "dummy" SPI transaction (such as reading command 
CONTROL_STATUS() ) to cause the HFO to waken, and continue this until a valid response is returned on 
SPI_MISO. At this point, the host can begin sending the intended SPI transactions. Afterward, the host can write 
0xAA to the 0x7F address, which will cause the HFO to turn off. Note that 0x7F FET Status()  is a read-only 
command, this special case of sending 0xAA to that command address is unrelated to the 0x7F FET Status() 
command.
The device includes ability to detect a frozen or disconnected SPI bus condition, and it will then reset the bus 
logic. This condition is recognized when the SPI_CS is low and the SPI_SCLK is static and not changing for a 
two second timeout.
9.3.1 SPI Protocol
The first byte of a SPI transaction consists of an R/W bit (R=0, W=1), followed by a 7-bit address, MSB first. If 
the controller (host) is writing, then the second byte will be the data to be written. If the controller is reading, then 
the second byte sent on SPI_MOSI is ignored (except for CRC calculation).
If CRC is enabled, then the controller must send as the third byte the 8-bit CRC code, which is calculated over 
the first two bytes. If the CRC is correct, then the values clocked in will be put into the incoming buffer. If the 
CRC is not correct, then the outgoing buffer will be set to 0xFFFF, and the outgoing CRC will be set to 0xAA 
(these are clocked out on the next transaction).
During this transaction, the logic will clock out the contents of the outgoing buffer. If the outgoing buffer has not 
been updated since the last transaction, then the logic will clock out 0xFFFF, and if the CRC is clocked, it will 
clock out 0x00 for the CRC (if enabled). Thus, the 0xFFFF00 will indicate to the controller that the outgoing 
buffer was not updated by the internal logic before the transaction occurred. This can occur when the device did 
not have sufficient time to update the buffer between consecutive transactions.
When the internal logic takes the write-data from the interface logic and processes it, it also causes the R/W bit, 
address, and data to be copied into the outgoing buffer. On the next transaction, this data is clocked back to the 
controller.
When the controller is initiating a read, the internal logic will place the R/W bit and address into the outgoing 
buffer, along with the data requested. The interface will compute the CRC on the two bytes in the outgoing buffer 
and clock that back to the controller if CRC is enabled (with the exceptions associated with 0xFFFF as noted 
above). A diagram of three transaction sequences with and without CRC are shown below, using CPOL=0.www.ti.com Serial Communications Interfaces

The time required for the device to process commands and subcommands will differ based on the specifics of 
each. For example, when the 0x0071 DASTATUS1()  subcommand is sent, the device requires approximately 
200 μs to load the 32-byte data into the internal subcommand buffer. If the host provides sufficient time for 
this load to complete before beginning to read the buffer (readback from addresses 0x40 to 0x5F), the device 
will respond with valid data, rather than 0xFFFF00. When data has already been loaded into the subcommand 
buffer, this data can be read back with approximately 50 μs interval between SPI transactions.
Note
Some commands or subcommands may take longer than 200 μs to complete. One exception is the 
IROM_SIG()  subcommand, which takes approximately 9 ms to complete.
The host software should incorporate a scheme to retry transactions that may not be successful. For example, 
if the device returns 0xFFFFFF on SPI_MISO, then the internal clock was not powered, and the transaction 
will need to be retried. Similarly, if the device returns 0xFFFFAA on a transaction, this indicates the previous 
transaction encountered a CRC error, and so the previous transaction must be retried. And as described above, 
if the device returns 0xFFFF00, then the previous transaction had not completed when the present transaction 
was sent, which may mean the previous transaction should be retried, or at least needs more time to complete.
The approximate time required to complete an operation based on the particular command or subcommand is 
shown below. Note that these times are only approximate and may vary depending on system operation at the 
time. Therefore, it is important that the host processor incorporate a retry scheme from the host processor, to 
handle communications errors or delays that may occur during operation.www.ti.com Serial Communications Interfaces

9.4 HDQ Communications Interface
The HDQ interface is an asynchronous return-to-one protocol where a processor communicates with the 
BQ76952 device using a single-wire connection to either the ALERT pin ( Settings:Configuration:Comm 
Type  = 3) or the HDQ pin ( Settings:Configuration:Comm Type  = 4). Note that the selected pin must be 
configured for use as the HDQ interface. Both the controller (host device) and responder (BQ76952) drive the 
HDQ interface using an open-drain driver, with a pull-up resistor from the HDQ interface to a supply voltage 
required on the circuit board. The BQ76952 device can be changed from the default I2C communication mode 
to HDQ communication mode by sending the 0x7C40 SWAP_TO_HDQ()  subcommand (at which point the 
device switches to HDQ mode using the ALERT pin immediately). Alternatively, the mode can be changed by 
setting the Settings:Configuration:Comm Type  configuration register in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, then exiting www.ti.com Serial Communications Interfaces

CONFIG_UPDATE mode, then sending the 0x29BC SWAP_COMM_MODE()  subcommand, at which point the 
device switches to the selected mode.
With HDQ, the least significant bit (LSB) of a data byte (command) or word (data) is transmitted first.
The 8-bit command code consists of two fields: the 7-bit HDQ command code (bits 0–6) and the 1-bit R/W field 
(MSB Bit 7). The R/W field directs the device to do one of the following:
•Accept the next 8 bits as data from the host to the device, or
•Output 8 bits of data from the device to the host in response to the 7-bit command.
The HDQ peripheral on the BQ76952 device can transmit and receive data as an HDQ responder only.
The return-to-one data bit frame of HDQ consists of the following sections:
1.The first section is used to start the transmission by the host sending a Break (the host drives the HDQ 
interface to a logic-low state for a time t (B)) followed by a Break Recovery (the host releases the HDQ 
interface for a time t (BR)).
2.The next section is for host command transmission, where the host transmits 8 bits by driving the HDQ 
interface for 8 T (CYCH)  time slots. For each time slot, the HDQ line is driven low for a time T (HW0)  (host 
writing a "0") or T (HW1)  (host writing a "1"). The HDQ pin is then released and remains high to complete each 
T(CYCH)  time slot.
3.The next section is for data transmission where the host (if a write was initiated) or device (if a read was 
initiated) transmits 8 bits by driving the HDQ interface for 8 T (CYCH)  (if host is driving) or T (CYCD)  (if device 
is driving) time slots. The HDQ line is driven low for a time T (HW0)  (host writing a "0"), T (HW1)  (host writing a 
"1"), T (DW0)  (device writing a "0"), or T (DW1)  (device writing a "1"). The HDQ pin is then released and remains 
high to complete the time slot. The HDQ interface does not auto-increment, so a separate transaction must 
be sent for each byte to be transferred.Serial Communications Interfaces www.ti.com

10.1 Cell Balancing Operation
The BQ76952 device supports passive cell balancing by bypassing the current of selected cells during charging 
or at rest, using either integrated bypass switches between cells, or external bypass transistors. The device 
incorporates a voltage-based balancing algorithm which can optionally balance cells autonomously without 
requiring any interaction with a host processor. Or if preferred, balancing can be entirely controlled manually 
from a host processor. For autonomous balancing, the device only balances non-adjacent cells in use (it does 
not consider inputs used to measure interconnect as cells in use). In order to avoid excessive power dissipation 
within the BQ76952 device, the maximum number of cells allowed to balance simultaneously can be limited by 
setting Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Max Cells . For host-controlled balancing, adjacent as 
well as non-adjacent cells can be balanced.
Host-controlled balancing can be controlled using specific subcommands (described below) sent by the 
host. These subcommands are also accessible in SEALED mode, to avoid the need for the pack to 
be unsealed in operation in order to initiate balancing. If host-controlled balancing will not be used, 
access to these subcommands can be disabled by setting the Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing 
Configuration[CB_NO_CMD]  configuration bit.
The subcommands used by the host to control cell balancing are described below.
Table 10-1. Host-Controlled Cell Balancing Subcommands
Subcommand Description
0x0083 CB_ACTIVE_CELLS()When read, this reports a bit mask of which cells are being actively balanced. When written, it starts 
balancing on the specified cells. Write 0x0000 to turn balancing off. This command may take up to 
approximately 1 second to take effect.
0x0084 CB_SET_LVL()When written with a 16-bit cell voltage threshold in mV, the device begins balancing one or more of the 
highest voltage cells if above the written threshold.
The device also returns status information regarding how long cells have been balanced through the 
subcommands described below.
Table 10-2. Cell Balancing Status Subcommands
Subcommand Description
0x0085 CBSTATUS1() When read, this returns the 16-bit time in seconds that balancing has been active.
0x0086 CBSTATUS2()When read, this returns a block containing the 32-bit cumulative balancing times in seconds for each of 
cells 1–8. These values reset if a device reset occurs, or the device enters CONFIG_UPDATE mode.
0x0087 CBSTATUS3()When read, this returns a block containing the 32-bit cumulative balancing times in seconds for each of 
cells 9–16. These values reset if a device reset occurs, or the device enters CONFIG_UPDATE mode.
When host-controlled balancing is initiated using the subcommands above, the device starts a timer and 
continues balancing until the timer reaches a value of Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Interval , 
or a new balancing subcommand is issued (which resets the timer). This is included as a precaution, in case the 
host processor initiated balancing but then stopped communication with the BQ76952 device, so that balancing 
would not continue indefinitely.
The BQ76952 device can automatically balance cells using a voltage-based algorithm based on environmental 
and system conditions. Several settings are provided to control when balancing is allowed, as described below.Chapter 10

Temperature —The device disables balancing (both autonomous and host-controlled) if the cell temperature is 
below Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Min Cell Temp  or above Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Max Cell 
Temp  or the internal die temperature of the device is above Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Max Internal 
Temp .
Charge versus Relax —Autonomous balancing can be allowed during charging by setting Settings:Cell 
Balancing Config:Balancing Configuration[CB_CHG] , or in a relaxed condition by setting Settings:Cell 
Balancing Config:Balancing Configuration[CB_RLX] , or both. If Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing 
Configuration[CB_CHG]  is set, autonomous balancing is allowed while the CC1 Current is above 
Settings:Current Thresholds:Chg Current Threshold . If Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing 
Configuration[CB_RLX]  is set, autonomous balancing is allowed while the current is below Settings:Current 
Thresholds:Chg Current Threshold  and above the negative of Settings:Current Thresholds:Dsg Current 
Threshold . The device evaluates the conditions for continuing balancing every Settings:Cell Balancing 
Config:Cell Balance Interval . For example, if the device is configured to avoid balancing during charge, 
and while balancing the pack begins charging, balancing continues until the interval timer expires before it is 
disabled.
Cell Voltage —If autonomous balancing during charge is enabled, the device allows balancing if the minimum 
cell voltage is above Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Min Cell V (Charge)  and the difference 
between the maximum and minimum cell voltages is greater than Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell 
Balance Min Delta (Charge) . Similarly, if autonomous balancing during relax is enabled, the device allows 
balancing if the minimum cell voltage is above Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Min Cell V 
(Relax)  and the difference between the maximum and minimum cell voltages is greater than Settings:Cell 
Balancing Config:Cell Balance Min Delta (Relax) .
While balancing during relax, when the device reevaluates the cell status at the end of each timer interval, 
it ceases balancing if all cell voltages are within Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Stop Delta 
(Relax)  of the minimum cell voltage. This Cell Balance Stop Delta  reduces the risk of over-balancing a higher 
voltage cell to slightly below the minimum voltage cell, and thereby slowly draining the pack. Operation while 
balancing during charge is similar, instead using the Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Stop Delta 
(Charge)  configuration value. The Cell Balance Stop Delta  parameters should be set to a lower level than the 
Cell Balance Min Delta  parameters, then the device will have a hysteresis that delays restarting balancing until 
the level of imbalance again exceeds the higher Cell Balance Min Delta  level. Note that when balancing is 
enabled because at least one cell voltage exceeds Cell Balance Min Delta , the device continues to attempt to 
balance all cells that are above the Cell Balance Stop Delta .
NORMAL versus SLEEP Mode —The BQ76952 device can also be configured to avoid autonomous balancing 
while in SLEEP mode by clearing the Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing Configuration[CB_SLEEP] 
configuration bit. The device can also be prevented from entering SLEEP mode while balancing if the 
Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing Configuration[CB_NOSLEEP]  bit is set. Table 10-3  shows the 
functionality based on these bits.
Table 10-3. Cell Balancing CB_SLEEP and CB_NOSLEEP Configuration Settings
CB_SLEEP CB_NOSLEEP Description
0 0Cell balancing is not allowed to occur while in SLEEP mode. If balancing were active when 
the device entered SLEEP mode, balancing would stop at the end of the present Cell Balance 
Interval  and could not restart until the device returned to NORMAL mode.
0 1 This setting is not allowed. When CB_NOSLEEP is set, CB_SLEEP should also be set.
1 0 Cell balancing is allowed to begin and continue while the device is in SLEEP mode.
1 1If the device is in SLEEP mode and cell balancing is deemed necessary, the device exits 
SLEEP mode to begin balancing. The device is prevented from reentering SLEEP mode while 
balancing is active.Cell Balancing www.ti.com

Note
Balancing is disabled immediately (without waiting for the interval timer to expire) if any of the 
following events occur:
•The device enters CONFIG_UPDATE mode.
•An enabled protection alert from Settings:Protections:Enabled Protections A  occurs.
•An enabled protection fault from Settings:Protections:Enabled Protections A  occurs except for 
a COV fault.
•An enabled Permanent Fail fault occurs.
•The device enters DEEPSLEEP mode.
•The device enters SHUTDOWN mode.
To disable autonomous cell balancing, the Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing 
Configuration[CB_CHG]  and Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Balancing Configuration[CB_RLX] 
configuration bits should be cleared.
Cell voltage measurements cannot be performed while balancing is underway due to the IR drop across the 
external cell input resistors significantly reducing the voltage at the device VC pins. Therefore, the device 
autonomously interrupts balancing briefly to allow cell voltage measurements to occur. During a measurement 
scan, the device disables balancing on any cell being measured, as well as any cell adjacent to that cell. 
Balancing is also disabled on the top cell while the top-of-stack voltage is being measured.
The COV and CUV protection checks for each cell normally operate every 3.3 ms when balancing is not 
enabled. To avoid balancing causing a protection alert or fault, the device disables the typical COV and CUV 
protection schedule while balancing is active. Every 1 second while balancing is active, the device briefly stops 
balancing of all cells, allows all COV and CUV protection checks to occur, then restarts balancing.
The device draws current through the VC16 pin to enable the balancing switches when balancing is active, 
resulting in approximately 35 μA flowing into the VC16 pin times the number of cells being balanced. To avoid 
this current affecting the cell 16-voltage measurements while balancing is active, minimize the cell 16-input 
resistor to reduce the IR drop across this resistor.
10.2 Cell Balancing Timing
Due to the current that flows into the cell input pins on the BQ76952 device while balancing is active, the 
measurement of cell voltages and evaluation of cell voltage protections by the device is modified during 
balancing. During the regular measurement loop, balancing is temporarily disabled on the cell that is being 
measured by the ADC. Balancing is also temporarily disabled on the cells adjacent to the cell being measured. 
Similarly, balancing on the top cell is disabled while the stack voltage measurement is underway. This occurs on 
every measurement loop, and so can result in significant reduction in the average balancing current that flows. 
In order to help alleviate this, the Settings:Configuration:Power Config[CB_LOOP_SLOW_1:0]  configuration 
bits cause the device to slow the measurement loop speed when cell balancing is active, as shown below. The 
BQ76952 device will insert current-only measurements after each voltage and temperature scan loop to slow 
down voltage measurements and thereby increase the average balancing current.
Table 10-4. Cell Balancing Loop Slow-Down Setting
CB_LOOP_SLOW_1 CB_LOOP_SLOW_0 Description
0 0 Measurement loop runs at full speed during balancing.
0 1 Measurement loop runs at half speed during balancing.
1 0 Measurement loop runs at quarter speed during balancing.
1 1 Measurement loop runs at eighth speed during balancing.
Note that the [LOOP_SLOW]  and [CB_LOOP_SLOW]  settings operate independently. The [LOOP_SLOW] 
setting determines the speed of the regular measurement loop while balancing is not active. The 
[CB_LOOP_SLOW]  setting determines the speed of the regular measurement loop only while balancing is 
active (the two settings do not combine together during balancing).www.ti.com Cell Balancing

In order to avoid the balancing current causing a protection alert or fault, the device modifies the timing on 
the CUV check on an actively balanced cell and the COV checks on adjacent cells, disabling balancing briefly 
every 1 second to allow these checks to occur. If a CUV or COV alert is detected at the 1-s check, balancing is 
immediately disabled. Note: the device will therefore have a different delay (≈1 second) in triggering a CUV or 
COV alert or fault on these cells while balancing is active. Timing for CUV and COV on other cells besides these 
being actively balanced or adjacent are not modified.
The device includes an internal die temperature check, to disable balancing if the die temperature exceeds a 
programmable threshold. However, the customer should still carefully analyze the thermal effect of the balancing 
on the device in system. Based on the planned ambient temperature of the device during operation and the 
thermal properties of the package, the maximum power should be calculated that can be dissipated within 
the device and still ensure operation remains within the recommended operating temperature range. The cell 
balancing configuration can then be determined such that the device power remains below this level by limiting 
the maximum number of cells that can be balanced simultaneously, or by reducing the balancing current of each 
cell by appropriate selection of the external resistance in series with each cell.
While autonomous cell balancing is underway, the conditions related to continuing or stopping balancing 
are re-evaluated at each Settings:Cell Balancing Config:Cell Balance Interval . During SLEEP mode, this 
reevaluation is done using the data available at the time, which is only updated every Power:Sleep:Voltage 
Time . Thus, there may be some delay related to these settings before balancing is changed based on the data.Cell Balancing www.ti.com

11.1 Diagnostics Overview
The BQ76952 device includes a suite of diagnostic tests that can be utilized by the system to improve 
robustness of operation.
11.2 VREF2 Versus VREF1 Check
The VREF2, which is used by the coulomb counter and LDOs, is measured indirectly using the voltage ADC 
(which uses VREF1) to measure the REG18 voltage (which is based on VREF2) and can be read back 
in bytes 0–1 of the 0x0075 DASTATUS5()  subcommand. This command should normally report a value of 
approximately 29137. If it differs significantly from this, it may indicate that one reference has changed in value 
significantly relative to the other, meaning reported measurements may no longer be accurate. This ratio is 
monitored periodically and, if the value is below 26223 or above 32051 for four seconds, the device can trigger 
a permanent fail (PF) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF C[VREF]  configuration bit.
11.3 VSS Measurement
The voltage ADC regularly measures the VSS signal and reports the result in bytes 2-3 of the 0x0075 
DASTATUS5()  subcommand. This command should normally report a value that is near zero. If it differs 
significantly from this, it may indicate the ADC input mux has experienced an error, meaning reported 
measurements may no longer be accurate. This measurement is monitored by the device and, if not as 
expected, can trigger a Permanent Fail (PF) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the 
Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[VSSF]  configuration bit, and the fail threshold and delay are set by 
Permanent Fail:VSSF:Fail Threshold  and Permanent Fail:VSSF:Delay .
11.4 Top of Stack Measurement Check
The voltage ADC regularly measures the top of stack voltage through an internal divider and reports this in 
0x34 Stack Voltage() . It also compares this measurement to the sum of the individual cell voltage measurements 
and can trigger a Permanent Fail (PF) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the 
Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF D[TOSF]  configuration bit, and the fail threshold and delay are set by 
Permanent Fail:TOS:Threshold  and Permanent Fail:TOSF:Delay . This check is not performed if the current is 
beyond Power:Sleep:Sleep Current , in order to avoid false triggers due to a dynamic load.
11.5 LFO Oscillator Monitor
The BQ76952 device includes a separate hardware monitor circuit, which determines if the LFO oscillator 
frequency deviates excessively from its expected value. If such a deviation is detected, the device can trigger a 
Permanent Fail (PF) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF C[LFOF]  configuration bit.
11.6 Protection Comparator Mux Check
The BQ76952 device implements a periodic check on the input mux for the hardware protection comparator 
subsystem used for the OV, UV, OCC, OCD1, and OCD2 primary protections. If this check fails, it can trigger a 
Permanent Fail (PF) and disable the battery pack. This PF can be enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF C[HWMX]  configuration bit.Chapter 11

11.7 Internal Watchdog Reset
The BQ76952 device integrates an internal watchdog circuit for the internal processor, which will trigger a 
watchdog fault if it is not serviced by the processor at regular intervals. A watchdog fault may occur if the internal 
processor is unexpectedly halted or overloaded with tasks, such as servicing excessive serial communications. 
When a watchdog fault occurs, the internal processor is reset, and the 0x12 Battery Status()[WD]  bit will be set 
after the reset is complete.
There are additional checks performed by the device which can also trigger a watchdog reset. The BQ76952 
device incorporates an ADC measurement watchdog, which monitors whether the ADC and coulomb counter 
measurements are completing as expected, and if not will trigger a watchdog fault. A RAM integrity check is also 
performed periodically and forces a watchdog reset if corruption is detected. If the device detects a RAM error 
within a programmable time (set by Power:Shutdown:RAM Fail Shutdown Time ) after a watchdog reset, the 
device will enter SHUTDOWN mode instead of resetting, in order to avoid unwanted reset loops in the case of a 
RAM failure.
11.8 Internal Memory Checks
The BQ76952 device implements a signature check on the instruction ROM for the internal processor at initial 
power up or upon reset. If this check fails, the device can trigger a Permanent Fail (PF) and disable the battery 
pack. This PF is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[IRMF]  configuration bit (this 
bit is enabled by default).
The device also implements a signature check at initial power up or after reset on the internal processor 
data ROM, which holds default values for the device configuration. If this check fails, the device can trigger 
a Permanent Fail (PF) and disable the battery pack. This PF is enabled by setting the Settings:Permanent 
Failure:Enabled PF C[DRMF]  configuration bit (this bit is enabled by default).
The device also implements a signature check at initial power up or after reset on the internal OTP memory, 
which may contain customer configuration data. If the OTP memory signature check fails, the device will not load 
customer settings from OTP, it will instead load the default configuration, trigger a Permanent Fail (PF), which 
keeps the FETs turned off (but will not blow the fuse) and the REG1 LDO disabled. This PF is enabled by setting 
the Settings:Permanent Failure:Enabled PF C[OTPF]  configuration bit (this bit is enabled by default). Note 
that the OTP signature does not include the Manufacturing Data (available using the 0x0070 MANU_DATA() 
subcommand) nor any PF status data which was previously written to OTP (which is read using the 0x0053 
SAVED_PF_STATUS()  subcommand).
The BQ76952 device implements a signature check of the factory trim information within the device after initial 
power-up and any device reset. If this check fails, the device begins the transition into SHUTDOWN mode.Diagnostics www.ti.com

0 = No Permanent Fail fault has triggered.
1 = At least one Permanent Fail fault has triggered.
11 SS This bit indicates whether or not an enabled safety fault is triggered.
0 = No safety fault is triggered.
1 = At least one enabled safety fault is triggered.
10 FUSE This bit reports the most recently observed state of the FUSE pin and is updated every 
second.
0 = FUSE pin was not asserted by device or secondary protector at last sample.
1 = FUSE pin was asserted by device or secondary protector at last sample.
9–8 SEC1–SEC0 These bits indicate the present security state of the device. When in SEALED mode, device 
configuration may not be read or written and some commands are restricted. When in 
UNSEALED mode, device configuration may normally be read and may be written while in 
CONFIG_UPDATE mode. When in FULLACCESS mode, unrestricted read and write access 
is allowed and all commands are accepted. Even in FULLACCESS mode, changes to device 
configuration should only be changed while also in CONFIG_UPDATE mode.

1 = Device is in FULLACCESS mode.
2 = Device is in UNSEALED mode.
3 = Device is in SEALED mode.
7 OTPB This bit indicates whether or not voltage and temperature conditions are valid for OTP 
programming. During normal operation, this bit will always be set if Manufacturing Status()
[OTPW]  is clear. When entering CONFIG_UPDATE mode, conditions will be checked and 
this bit will reflect whether or not programming is allowed ( Manufacturing Status()[OTPW] 
does not apply in CONFIG_UPDATE mode). Once in CONFIG_UPDATE mode, this bit will 
not change state since no new measurements are being taken.
0 = OTP writes are allowed.
1 = Writes to OTP are blocked.
6 OTPW This bit indicates whether or not some data is waiting to be written to OTP during normal 
operation. This can occur when, for example, configured to Permanent Fail information to 
OTP. This bit may remain set until conditions for OTP programming are met and all data is 
programmed. This bit is not set during OTP programming from CONFIG_UPDATE mode.
0 = No writes to OTP are pending.
1 = Writes to OTP are pending.
5 COW_CHK This bit indicates while cell open-wire checks are occurring. When the feature is disabled, 
this bit will not set. When the feature is enabled, this bit will set periodically as the checks 
are performed.
0 = Device is not actively performing a cell open-wire check.
1 = Device is actively performing a cell open-wire check.Commands and Subcommands www.ti.com

13.1 Data Memory Access
The data memory values in BQ76952 are accessed in similar fashion to subcommands, using the address for a 
data value rather than the subcommand address. For example, to write the Calibration:Voltage:Cell 1 Gain  to 
a value of 12410 (0x307A), determine the register address from the Data Memory Summary Table, which shows 
this address is 0x9180. Then the data is written as shown below:
1.Write lower byte of address to 0x3E (0x80 in this example).
2.Write upper byte of address to 0x3F (0x91 in this example).
3.Write the data memory value in little endian format into the transfer buffer (0x40 to 0x5F). Note: up to 32 
bytes of data memory can be written in one block write. In this example, write 0x7A to 0x40, write 0x30 to 
0x41.
4.Write the checksum of data written (0x44 in this example) into 0x60, and the length of data (0x06 in this 
example) into 0x61.
5.The data can be verified by reading it back. Write the lower byte of address to 0x3E (0x80), write the upper 
byte of address to 0x3F (0x91).
6.Read the length of response from 0x61. The transfer buffer will be populated with a 32-byte block of data, so 
length will be 36-bytes, or 0x24 for this example.
7.Read buffer starting at 0x40 for the length of data. The new value for Calibration:Voltage:Cell 1 Gain  is 
seen in 0x40 (0x7A) and 0x41 (0x30).
8.Read the checksum at 0x60 and verify it matches the data read for the full transfer buffer.
Note: 0x61 provides the length of the buffer data + 4 (that is, length of buffer data + length of 0x3E and 0x3F + 
length of 0x60 and 0x61).
The checksum is calculated over 0x3E and 0x3F and the buffer data, it does not include the checksum or length 
in 0x60 and 0x61.
The configuration settings for the BQ76952 device are shown in the following sections.

this bit is ignored. When configured for FET temperature, it is not factored into 
minimum, maximum, and average cell temperature calculations.

2 USER_VOLTS_CV 1 Some of the BQ769x2 family of devices support high voltages. To ensure the 
Top-of-Stack, PACK, and LD pin voltages fit in a signed 16-bit integer type, their 
units are configurable. This configurable unit is called user-volts and can be 
set to either centivolts or millivolts. For applications which will not exceed 32 
Volts, millivolts may be used. Other applications should use centivolts to avoid 
saturating at 32767 mV.

current to allow it to scale with the anticipated load.

Description : Not every system will use all of the cell input pins. If the system has fewer cells than the device 
supports, some VC input pins may be shorted together or used to measure interconnect resistance between 
cells. To prevent action being taken for cell under-voltage conditions on pins that are shorted or used to measure 
interconnect resistance, the corresponding Vcell Mode bit should be cleared. If all Vcell Mode bits are cleared, 
then all inputs are considered as cell connections.Data Memory Settings www.ti.com

10 SCDL_CURR_RECOV 0 The SCD Latch fault may recover based on load removal detection on the LD 
pin, by host command, or by charge current. When the current-based recovery 
mechanism is not desired, it can be disabled by clearing this bit.
0 = SCDL does not recover based on charge current.

9 OCDL_CURR_RECOV 0 The OCD Latch fault may recover based on load removal detection on the LD

mechanism is not desired, it can be disabled by clearing this bit.
0 = OCDL does not recover based on charge current.
1 = OCDL recovers when current is greater than or equal to 
Protections:OCDL:Recovery Threshold  for Protections:OCDL:Recovery 
Time .
8 FETF_FUSE 0 When a Permanent Failure has been detected, the device may be 
configured to blow the fuse. This normally requires the voltage being above 
Settings:Fuse:Min Blow Fuse Voltage . When this bit is set and a FET failure 
occurs (CFETF or DFETF), the voltage requirement is bypassed.
0 = Voltage must be above a threshold to blow the fuse when CFETF or DFETF 
trips.
1 = If configured to blow the fuse and CFETF or DFETF occurs, fuse blow is 
attempted regardless of voltage.
7 PACK_FUSE 0 The fuse is typically located on the BAT side of the FETs, so the device monitors 
the Top of Stack voltage to determine if fuse blow is possible. However, some 
systems may place the fuse on the PACK side, in which case the PACK pin 
voltage should be monitored to determine if fuse blow is possible. Setting this bit 
causes the device to use the PACK pin voltage instead of the Top of Stack pin 
voltage for this comparison.
0 = Top of Stack voltage must be above Settings:Fuse:Min Blow Fuse Voltage 
in order to blow the fuse.
1 = PACK voltage must be above Settings:Fuse:Min Blow Fuse Voltage  in 
order to blow the fuse.Data Memory Settings www.ti.com

Table 13-17. Protection Configuration Register Field Descriptions (continued)
Bit Field Default Description
5 PF_OTP 0 Since the device stores Permanent Failure status in RAM, that status would be 
lost when the device resets. To mitigate this, the device can write Permanent 
Failure status to OTP when this bit is set. OTP programming may be delayed in 
low-voltage and high-temperature conditions until OTP programming can reliably 
be accomplished. Note that writes to OTP during operation are only allowed 
if Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[OTPW_EN]  is set. If this bit is set 
but Settings:Manufacturing:Mfg Status Init[OTPW_EN]  is clear, Permanent 
Failure status is saved to RAM that is preserved across a partial reset but will not 
be programmed to OTP. If this bit is not set, Permanent Failure status will be lost 
on any reset, including a partial reset via the RST_SHUT pin.
0 = Permanent Failure status is lost on reset.
1 = Permanent Failure status is preserved across reset when possible.
4 PF_FUSE 0 When a Permanent Failure occurs, the device may be configured to blow the fuse 
when voltage conditions are met.
0 = Permanent Failure does not cause the device to blow the fuse.
1 = Permanent Failure causes the device to blow the fuse.
3 PF_DPSLP 0 Normally, a Permanent Failure causes the FETs to remain off indefinitely and 
the fuse may be blown. In that situation, there is no further action that would be 
taken on further monitoring operations. Additionally, charging would no longer be 
possible. To avoid rapidly draining the battery, the device may be configured to 
enter DEEPSLEEP mode when a Permanent Failure occurs. DEEPSLEEP will 
still be delayed until after fuse blow and OTP programming are completed if those 
options are enabled.
0 = Device does not automatically enter DEEPSLEEP mode when a Permanent 
Failure occurs.
1 = Device automatically enters DEEPSLEEP mode when a Permanent Failure 
occurs.
2 PF_REGS 0 When a Permanent Failure occurs, the device may be configured to either turn 
the regulators off or to leave them in their present state. Once disabled, they may 
still be re-enabled via command.
0 = Permanent Failure does not cause the device to turn the regulators off.
1 = Permanent Failure causes the device to turn the regulators off.
1 PF_FETS 1 When a Permanent Failure occurs, the device normally will turn the FETs off. An 
option is provided to disable this behavior if the host wants to maintain greater 
control.
0 = Permanent Failure does not cause the device to turn the FETs off.
1 = Permanent Failure causes the device to turn the FETs off.

13.3.8.1 Settings:Cell Open-Wire:Check Time
Class Subclass Name Type Min Max Default Unit
Settings Cell Open-Wire Check Time U1 0 255 5 s
Description : If a cell connection to the device is detached, the capacitance on the node may maintain the 
voltage for some time. To detect this condition, the device can periodically enable a current source to VSS 
on each cell connection to drain the charge on the node. When a cell is detached, that node voltage is 
discharged, and an over-voltage or under-voltage event will be triggered on that cell or an adjacent cell 
differential measurement. The current source is enabled for the duration of an ADC measurement (3 ms 
by default) once per the interval defined by this parameter. A longer interval decreases the average current 
consumption at the cost of detection time. When using this feature, cell balancing should be considered as well 
since the current flows from the cell pin to VSS, resulting in a higher average current drawn from lower cells.
0 = Cell open-wire check is disabled.
All other values = Cell open-wire check current source is enabled briefly for each cell on this interval.

automatically enter SHUTDOWN again after a number of minutes defined by this parameter. If communications 
occur after the first second, or if charge current is detected, or if discharge current above the SLEEP current 
threshold is detected after one minute, automatic shutdown is cancelled. If none of those events occur, after this 
number of minutes, the FETs will be turned off for up to five seconds. During that 5 seconds, if the PACK and 
LD pin voltages fall, the device will enter shutdown. If the voltage on those pins remain above their respective 
thresholds, auto-shutdown is cancelled based on a conclusion that a charger is present.

Bit Field Default Description
2 PERM_SEAL 0 Setting this bit prevents unsealing the device once it is sealed. If this is not 
programmed to OTP, this setting will be lost on a full reset and the device will 
again be able to UNSEAL.
0 = The device can be unsealed by sending the correct security keys.
1 = The device cannot be unsealed.
1 LOCK_CFG 0 Setting this bit prevents entry into CONFIG_UPDATE and FULLACCESS 
modes. This prevents further modifications to the device configuration after 
CONFIG_UPDATE mode is exited.
0 = Configuration parameters can be changed in CONFIG_UPDATE mode.
1 = Configuration parameters cannot be changed.
0 SEAL 0 Setting this bit causes the device to enter SEALED mode when reset or exiting 
CONFIG_UPDATE and DEEPSLEEP modes. In production systems, this bit 
should be set for security purposes.
0 = Device does not default to SEALED mode.
1 = Device default state is SEALED.
